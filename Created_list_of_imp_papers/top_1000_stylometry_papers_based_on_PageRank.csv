The Effectiveness of Stemming in the Stylometric Authorship Attribution in Arabic,2020,https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2020.0110114,20,"The recent years have witnessed the development of numerous approaches to authorship attribution including statistical and linguistic methods. Stylometric authorship attribution, however, remains among the most widely used due to its accuracy and effectiveness. Nevertheless, many authorship problems remain unresolved in terms of Arabic. This can be attributed to different factors including linguistic peculiarities that are not usually considered in standard authorship systems. In the case of Arabic, the morphological features carry unique stylistic features that can be usefully used in testing authorship in controversial texts and writings. The hypothesis is that much of these morphological features are lost due to the execution of stemming. As such, this study is concerned with investigating the effectiveness of stemming in the stylometric applications to authorship attribution in Arabic. In so doing, three Arabic stemmers GOLD stemmer, Khoga stemmer, Light 10 stemmer are used. By way of illustration, a corpus of 2400 news articles written by different 97 authors is designed. To evaluate the effectiveness of stemming, the selected articles (both stemmed and unstemmed texts) are clustered using cluster analysis methods. Comparisons are made between clustering structures based on stemmed and unstemmed datasets. The results indicate that stemming has negative impacts on the accuracy of the clustering performance and thus on the reliability of stylometric authorship testing in Arabic. The peculiar stylistic features of the affixation processes in Arabic can, thus, be usefully used for improving the performance of authorship attribution applications in Arabic. It can be finally concluded that stemming is not effective in the stylometric authorship applications in Arabic.","['Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Natural language processing', 'Arabic', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Cluster analysis', 'Attribution', 'Linguistics', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Wafya Ibrahim']",33,True,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0
Stylometric Authorship Attribution for the Middle Dutch Mystical Tradition from Groenendaal,2016,https://doi.org/10.1080/03096564.2016.1252077,5,"The well-known medieval Groenendaal monastery in Brabant has produced some of the finest examples of medieval Dutch literature, including Jan van Ruusbroec's œuvre, who together with Anne Frank, remains the most frequently translated Dutch author of all time. Authorship attribution nevertheless remains a serious scholarly concern when it comes to the corpus of mystical texts from Groenendaal: because of the general proximity of the Groenendaal authors, their œuvres can be difficult to delineate. In this paper, I apply a quantitative, style-based methodology for authorship attribution to a sizable corpus of Groenendaal authors. These computational techniques are borrowed from the innovative field of stylometry in the Digital Humanities. I will discuss how the experimental results obtained are able to confirm and complement many of the authorship-related hypotheses developed in traditional Middle Dutch studies. Additionally, this work aims to demonstrate the exciting scholarly potential of 'Distant Reading' for the study of the rich textual heritage from the medieval Low Countries.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Mysticism', 'Attribution', 'Reading (process)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Literature', 'Field (mathematics)', 'History', 'Epistemology', 'Linguistics', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics']",['Mike Kestemont'],15,False,Dutch Crossing,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0
Stylometry and Automatic Attribution of Medieval Liturgical Monodies,2018,https://doi.org/10.4000/ijcol.518,0,"While automatic attribution of literary text as well as stylometry evaluation are nowadays well-established research areas, much less has been done in the field of musicology. Here we present the results of the implementation of an automatic stylometric attribution technique to a corpus of liturgical monodies of medieval origin (the so-called Gregorian Chant, Old Roman Chant and Ambrosian Chant). The 'unidimensional' nature of the musical repertoires investigated (rhythm-free melody without accompaniment) allows the adoption of a known method based on a pseudo-distance between frequency-vectors of n-gram of consecutive symbols. Finally, we show that some specific features of musicological interest inside the three liturgical families can be naturally extracted using a statistical analysis of n-gram distributions. The results presented show that a quantitative approach is well suited to support and accompany the investigation of refined problems in musicology.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Art', 'Natural language processing', 'Psychology', 'Computer science', 'Social psychology']","['Francesco Unguendoli', 'Giampaolo Cristadoro', 'Marco Beghelli']",6,True,Italian Journal of Computational Linguistics,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0

"Robert Musil, a war journal, and stylometry: Tackling the issue of short texts in authorship attribution",2018,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy055,20,"Abstract During World War I (WWI), between 1916 and 1917, Robert Musil was the chief editor of the Tiroler Soldaten-Zeitung in Bozen. This activity probably also involved authorship of articles and has posed a philological problem to scholars, who have not been able to attribute with certainty a range of relatively short texts to Musil. With this article, we present a new approach that combines philological research with stylometric methods. Exploration of WWI archives and digitization of historical documents were paired with application of authorship attribution techniques, following extensive evaluation. To build the training set, we adapted the ‘impostors method’ by grouping three ‘distractor authors’ (similar to Musil in terms of style) and three actual candidates for authorship. In the test set, we developed two designs for tackling the issue of text length: a combinatory design, where longer chunks were composed by the juxtaposition of short texts; a simplified design, where the texts for attribution were merged with already attributed texts. Results of our experiment suggest that Musil attribution may be disproved with a high level of confidence for ten texts that were more probably written by a less well-known author, Albert Ritter. We carried out a keyness analysis on the specific words preferred or avoided by the two authors, which not only corroborated the results of the quantitative analysis but also findings from Musil philology. Our study showcases the potentialities of using mixed methods in stylometry.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Philology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Certainty', 'Computer science', 'Literature', 'History', 'Art', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Feminism', 'Social psychology', 'Programming language']","['Simone Rebora', 'J.

$CAG$ : Stylometric Authorship Attribution of Multi-Author Documents Using a Co-Authorship Graph,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.2967449,19,"Stylometry has been successfully applied to perform authorship identification of single-author documents (AISD). The AISD task is concerned with identifying the original author of an anonymous document from a group of candidate authors. However, AISD techniques are not applicable to the authorship identification of multi-author documents (AIMD). Unlike AISD, where each document is written by one single author, AIMD focuses on handling multi-author documents. Due to the combinatoric nature of documents, AIMD lacks the ground truth information-that is, information on writing and non-writing authors in a multi-author document-which makes this problem more challenging to solve. Previous AIMD solutions have a number of limitations: (i) the best stylometry-based AIMD solution has a low accuracy, less than 30%; (ii) increasing the number of co-authors of papers adversely affects the performance of AIMD solutions; and (iii) AIMD solutions were not designed to handle the non-writing authors (NWAs). However, NWAs exist in real-world cases-that is, there are papers for which not every co-author listed has contributed as a writer. This paper proposes an AIMD framework called the Co-Authorship Graph that can be used to (i) capture the stylistic information of each author in a corpus of multi-author documents and (ii) make a multi-label prediction for a multi-author query document. We conducted extensive experimental studies on one synthetic and three real-world corpora. Experimental results show that our proposed framework (i) significantly outperformed competitive techniques; (ii) can effectively handle a larger number of co-authors in comparison with competitive techniques; and (iii) can effectively handle NWAs in multi-author documents.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Information retrieval', 'Identification (biology)', 'Task (project management)', 'Graph', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Botany', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Raheem Sarwar', 'Norawit Urailertprasert', 'Nattapol Vannaboot', 'Chenyun Yu', 'Thanawin Rakthanmanon', 'Ekapol Chuangsuwanich', 'Sarana Nutanong']",55,True,IEEE Access,['Thailand Research Fund'],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0
Authorship Attribution of Short Historical Arabic Texts using Stylometric Features and a KNN Classifier with Limited Training Data,2020,https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2020.1334.1345,1,"Authorship Attribution (AA) is a task that aims to recognize the authorship of unknown texts based on writing style. Out of the various approaches to solve the AA problem, Stylometry is a promising one. This paper explores the use of a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier combined with stylometry features to perform AA. This study indicates the robustness of KNN in performing AA on short historical Arabic texts written by different authors. To classify the texts according to the author, KNN was trained with a set of stylometry features including rare words, count characters and 2-, 3- and 4-grams character levels. Various feature set sizes ranging from 34 to 2000 were tested in the experiment. The experiments were conducted on limited training data with datasets consisting of 3 short texts per the author’s book. This method proved to be at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) when selecting the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the KNN classifier achieved high accuracy results with the best classification accuracy of up to 90%, except for the 5-KK using the 4-gram character level. This work contributes towards utilizing KNN for identifying the distinctive stylometry feature for robust AA identification in short historical Arabic texts.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Training set', 'Arabic', 'Natural language processing', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Writing style', 'k-nearest neighbors algorithm', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy']","['Fatma Howedi', 'Masnizah Mohd', 'Zahra Aborawi Aborawi', 'Salah A.

Gender Attribution: Tracing Stylometric Evidence Beyond Topic and Genre,2011,,106,"Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973)) postulate that women's language styles differ from that of men. In this paper, we explore statistical techniques that can learn to identify the gender of authors in modern English text, such as web blogs and scientific papers. Although recent work has shown the efficacy of statistical approaches to gender attribution, we conjecture that the reported performance might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic factors such as topic bias in gender that can make the gender detection task easier. Our work is the first that consciously avoids gender bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evidence to gender-specific styles in language beyond topic.

Authorship attribution of Morsi Gameel Aziz’s lyrics: A clustering-based stylometry approach,2021,https://doi.org/10.52462/jlls.36,2,"Numerous studies have addressed the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics. These studies have traditionally been based on chronological criteria for determining the real authors of disputed lyrics. To date, there is no agreement on the real authors of these disputed lyrics. This can mainly be attributed to both selectivity and the lack of empirical evidence in such studies, raising questions about the reliability of such approaches. With the advent of machine learning systems and data mining techniques, it is now possible to process thousands of texts using replicable methods. Thus, this study seeks to address the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics making use of these advances by applying a clustering-based stylometry approach. The hypothesis is that lyrics grouped or clustered together are more likely to be written by the same poet. A corpus of 1,089 lyrics was built, including all known lyrics attributed to Aziz and the lyrics of the poets thought to be the real authors of the disputed lyrics. The lyrics were clustered using the Gibbs sampling Dirichlet multinomial mixture (GSDMM) technique, and were assigned to 4 main classes, with the 12 disputed lyrics clustered within Azizâ€™s class. Based on this, it is clear that the GSDMM model is effective and reliable in clustering short documents in Arabic. The results of the study show that machine learning systems and stylometric authorship techniques can be used in resolving many authorship questions that remain controversial and unanswered in Arabic literature.","['Lyrics', 'Stylometry', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Art']",['Abdulfattah Omar'],59,True,Journal of Language and Linguistic Studies,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0

Dropping down the Maximum Item Set: Improving the Stylometric Authorship Attribution Algorithm in the Text Mining for Authorship Investigation,2010,https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2010.235.243,6,"Problem statement: Stylometric authorship attribution is an approach concerned about analyzing texts in text mining, e.g., novels and plays that famous authors wrote, trying to measure the authors style, by choosing some attributes that shows the author style of writing, assuming that these writers have a special way of writing that no other writer has; thus, authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. In this study, we propose an authorship attribution algorithm, improving the accuracy of Stylometric features of different professionals so it can be discriminated nearly as well as fingerprints of different persons using authorship attributes.

Results: To improve the techniques of the AA, we need to use new pack of attributes with a new measurement tool, the first pack of attributes we are using in this study is the (frequent pair) which means a pair of words that always appear together, this attribute clearly is not a new one, but it wasn't a successive attribute compared with the frequent word, using the maximum item set counters. the words pair made some mistakes as we see in the experiment results, improving the winnow algorithm by combining it with the computational approach, achieved by us","['Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Stylometry', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Task (project management)', 'Statement (logic)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Word (group theory)', 'Ranking (information retrieval)', 'Rank (graph theory)', 'Data mining', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'History', 'Programming language', 'Mathematics', 'Combinatorics']",['Mustafa'],9,True,Journal of Computer Science,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0

We suggest a new, simple and efficient method, which is merely based on counting the number of repetitions of each alphabetic letter in the text, instead of using the traditional classification properties; such as the contents of the text and style of the author; which falls into four feature categories: lexical, syntactic, structural, and content-specific. Furthermore, we apply a spherical classification method. We apply the proposed technique to the work of two Italian writers, Dante Alighieri and Brunetto Latini. With almost high reliability, the spherical classifier proved its ability to discriminate between the selected authors.

Adversarial stylometry,2012,https://doi.org/10.1145/2382448.2382450,183,"The use of stylometry, authorship recognition through purely linguistic means, has contributed to literary, historical, and criminal investigation breakthroughs. Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation , where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation , where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67% of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks.

Finding characteristic features in stylometric analysis,2015,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqv048,7,"The usual focus in authorship studies is on authorship attribution, i.e. determining which author (of a given set) wrote a piece of unknown provenance. The usual setting involves a small number of candidate authors, which means that the focus quickly revolves around a search for features that discriminate among the candidates. Whether the features that serve to discriminate among the authors are characteristic is then not of primary importance. We respectfully suggest an alternative in this article, namely a focus on seeking features that are characteristic for an author with respect to others. To determine an author’s characteristic features, we first seek elements that he or she uses consistently, which we therefore regard as ‘representative’, but we likewise seek elements which the author uses ‘distinctively’ in comparison to an opposing author. We test the idea on a task recently proposed that compares Charles Dickens to both Wilkie Collins and a larger reference set comprising several authors’ works from the 18th and 19th century. We then compare the use of representative and distinctive features to Burrows’ ‘Delta’ and Hoovers’ ‘CoV Tuning’; we find that our method bears little similarity with either method in terms of characteristic feature selection. We show that our method achieves reliable and consistent results in the two-author comparison and fair results in the multi-author one, measured by separation ability in clustering.","['Focus (optics)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Stylometry', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Computer science', 'Task (project management)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Cluster analysis', 'Selection (genetic algorithm)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Natural language processing', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Linguistics', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Engineering', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Systems engineering', 'Optics', 'Programming language']","['Carmen Klaussner', 'John Nerbonne', 'Çağrı Çöltekin']",21,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Towards a Linguistic Stylometric Model for the Authorship Detection in Cybercrime Investigations,2019,https://doi.org/10.5539/ijel.v9n5p182,6,"This study proposes an integrated framework that considers letter-pair frequencies/combinations along with the lexical features of documents as a means to identifying the authorship of short texts posted anonymously on social media. Taking a quantitative morpho-lexical approach, this study tests the hypothesis that letter information, or mapping, can identify unique stylistic features. As such, stable word combinations and morphological patterns can be used successfully for authorship detection in relation to very short texts. This method offers significant potential in the fight against online hate speech, which is often posted anonymously and where authorship is difficult to identify. The data analyzed is from a corpus of 12,240 tweets derived from 87 Twitter accounts. A self-organizing map (SOM) model was used to classify input patterns in the tweets that shared common features. Tweets grouped in a particular class displayed features that suggested they were written by a particular author. The results indicate that the accuracy of classification according to the proposed system was around 76%. Up to 22% of this accuracy was lost, however, when only distinctive words were used and 26% was lost when the classification procedure was based solely on letter combinations and morphological patterns. The integration of letter-pairs and morphological patterns had the advantage of improving accuracy when determining the author of a given tweet. This indicates that the integration of different linguistic variables into an integrated system leads to better performance in classifying very short texts. It is also clear that the use of a self-organizing map (SOM) led to better clustering performance because of its capacity to integrate two different linguistic levels for each author profile.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Class (philosophy)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Word (group theory)', 'Part of speech', 'Stylometry', 'Relation (database)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Data mining', 'Philosophy']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Aldawsari Bader Deraan']",25,True,International Journal of English Linguistics,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

The texts from different authors were represented by tones, tone motifs, and word length motifs as well as rimes and rime motifs. Support vector machines and random forests were used to establish the text classification model for authorship attribution. From the results of the experiments, we conclude that the combination of bigrams of rimes, word-final rimes, and segment -final rimes can discriminate the texts from different authors effectively when using random forests to establish the classification model. This robust approach can in principle be applied to other languages with established phonological inventory of onset and rimes.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Bigram', 'Lexicalization', 'Speech recognition', 'Trigram']","['Renkui Hou', 'Chu‐Ren Huang']",85,False,Natural Language Engineering,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

The first approach is related to Benford’s Law and the analysis of the frequency distribution of various leading digits of numerals contained in the text. In coherent literary texts, the share of the leading digit 1 is even larger than prescribed by Benford’s Law and can reach 50 percent. The frequencies of occurrence of the digit 1, as well as, to a lesser extent, the digits 2 and 3, are usually a characteristic the author’s style feature, manifested in all (sufficiently long) literary texts of any author. This approach is convenient for testing whether a group of texts has common authorship: the latter is dubious if the frequency distributions are sufficiently different. The second approach is the extension of the first one and requires the study of the frequency distribution of numerals themselves (not their leading digits). The approach yields non-trivial information about the author, stylistic and genre peculiarities of the texts and is suited for the advanced stylometric analysis.

It is useful to find out the author with a given set of text based on author writing style. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Various methods that include Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) have been used to find text patterns that exist within a text based database. The classification of the text patterns is deterministic whereas the authorship attribution to the text is un-deterministic. This paper presents a method that recognize a text pattern by using the authorship features using different phases of processing which include prior processing, extracting the features, feature selection, classifying the features and then finally leading to finding the author. Findings: The task of Authorship Attribution can be imposed to a range of exercises such as Scientific Analysis, Stealing Recognition and Authorship Recognition. Exploration in the part of Authorship Attribution is in view for more than 100 centuries, but the completed consequences were unacceptable. A range of provocations have been referred which include information collections, tokenizing of the content, applying Natural Language Tools, suitability of categorization methods and reorganization of a range of appearance which can discriminate one writer from the other writers. From the prevailing analysis, it can be concluded that the pronounced accruement are individual circumstance scene of situations, since it may not be useful to other consequences of Authorship Attribution associations.

Authorship Attribution for a Resource Poor Language—Urdu,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3487061,10,"Authorship attribution refers to examining the writing style of authors to determine the likelihood of the original author of a document from a given set of potential authors. Due to the wide range of authorship attribution applications, a plethora of studies have been conducted for various Western, as well as Asian, languages. However, authorship attribution research in the Urdu language has just begun, although Urdu is widely acknowledged as a prominent South Asian language. Furthermore, the existing studies on authorship attribution in Urdu have addressed a considerably easier problem of having less than 20 candidate authors, which is far from the real-world settings. Therefore, the findings from these studies may not be applicable to the real-world settings. To that end, we have made three key contributions: First, we have developed a large authorship attribution corpus for Urdu, which is a low-resource language. The corpus is composed of over 2.6 million tokens and 21,938 news articles by 94 authors, which makes it a closer substitute to the real-world settings. Second, we have analyzed hundreds of stylometry features used in the literature to identify 194 features that are applicable to the Urdu language and developed a taxonomy of these features. Finally, we have performed 66 experiments using two heterogeneous datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of four traditional and three deep learning techniques. The experimental results show the following: (a) Our developed corpus is many folds larger than the existing corpora, and it is more challenging than its counterparts for the authorship attribution task, and (b) Convolutional Neutral Networks is the most effective technique, as it achieved a nearly perfect F1 score of 0.989 for an existing corpus and 0.910 for our newly developed corpus.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Urdu', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Resource (disambiguation)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Taxonomy (biology)', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Computer network', 'Philosophy', 'Botany', 'Biology', 'Programming language', 'Archaeology']","['Zulqarnain Nazir', 'Khurram Shahzad', 'Muhammad Kamran Malik', 'Waheed Anwar', 'Imran Sarwar Bajwa', 'Khawar Mehmood']",44,False,ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Zeta, a test widely used in computational stylistics, is described by Gabriel Egan as ‘by some way the most powerful general-purpose authorship tool currently available’. This article offers extensive independent testing of Zeta. Following criticism of the existing method of Zeta analysis, this article introduces a new, statistically sound method for analysing Zeta results. It investigates a claim that the test is 99.9% reliable in differentiating Shakespeare’s style from Marlowe’s. Examining the conditions under which certain authors were ruled in or out of co-authorship of the Henry VI plays, it determines the effect of disparity in data set size on Zeta’s reliability, as well the effect of small data sets. Several test results confirm that Zeta is unduly influenced by genre. The article concludes that in the light of this study, the small canons of most Early Modern dramatists, particularly where they are genre-skewed like Marlowe’s, do not provide enough data for Zeta to be reliable","['Stylometry', 'Criticism', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Variance (accounting)', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics education', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Paleontology', 'Power (physics)', 'Accounting', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Business']",['R.

A statistical analysis of different articles by different writers was created that can identify the real author. An artificial neural network model was developed to identify a writer from an unknown document and it achieved above 85% accuracy rate for each writer.

This study demonstrates how widely available Universal Dependency parsers can generate useful morphological and syntactic data for texts in a range of languages. These data can serve as the basis for input features that are strongly informative about the style of individual novels, as indicated by accuracy in classification tests.

Detection of Online Contract Cheating Through Stylometry: A Pilot Study,2020,https://doi.org/10.24059/olj.v24i2.2096,37,"Contract cheating, instances in which a student enlists someone other than themselves to produce coursework, has been identified as a growing problem within academic integrity literature and in news headlines. The percentage of students who have utilized this type of cheating has been reported to range between 6% and 15.7%. Generational sentiments about cheating and the prevalent accessibility of contract cheating providers online seems to only have exacerbated the issue. The problem is that there is currently no simple means identified and verified to detect contract cheating, as available plagiarism detection software has been shown to be ineffective in these cases. One method that is commonly used for authorship authentication in nonacademic settings, stylometry, has been suggested as a potential means for detection. Stylometry uses various attributes of documents to determine if they were written by the same individual. This pilot study sought to assess the utility of three easy to use and readily available stylometry software systems to detect simulated cases of contract cheating on academic documents. Average accuracy ranged from 33% to 88.9%. While more research is necessary to further investigate the reliability of the best performing software packages, stylometry software appears to show significant promise for the potential detection of contract cheating.","['Cheating', 'Stylometry', 'Coursework', 'Academic integrity', 'Plagiarism detection', 'Computer science', 'Software', 'Malware', 'Academic dishonesty', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics education', 'Programming language']",['David Ison'],29,True,Online Learning,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Stylometry Based Authorship Identification,2018,https://doi.org/10.22214/ijraset.2018.4640,0,"Every person is unique"", we have been hearing this since ages.Every person has a unique identity, a unique fingerprint, a unique retina and a lot more.These features play a vital role in identification of individuals for security purposes.Unfortunately, when it comes to security of written pieces or words from an individual, these primary unique identities are futile. One cannot identify a writer from a written piece of text on the basis of retina or fingerprint scans, sometimes even the signature can be forged, in such situations for security purposes and intellectual property rights it becomes very important to identify the true author. Stylometry plays an important role in this. Every author has a unique style of writing, measure of this style of writing is called Stylometry. This paper proposes to identify authors from text based on their style of writing. First a data set consisting of articles, short stories and emails will be used to train the system for multiple authors, then a random text would be given to the system to identify the author correctly, if the author predicted by the system is similar to the author claimed then the information is authentic otherwise the author claiming to be the writer is a fraud. For stylometry, over the ages, many features have been focused on, but this paper proposes new features to be used for this purpose. While writing, there are many unconscious styles that are incorporated by the author, these features have been unnoticed till date, but can play a vital role in accurate and fast identification of authors.

De‐anonymizing Ethereum blockchain smart contracts through code attribution,2020,https://doi.org/10.1002/nem.2130,22,"Summary Blockchain users are identified by addresses (public keys), which cannot be easily linked back to them without out‐of‐network information. This provides pseudo‐anonymity, which is amplified when the user generates a new address for each transaction. Since all transaction history is visible to all users in public blockchains, finding affiliation between related addresses undermines pseudo‐anonymity. Such affiliation information can be used to discriminate against addresses linked with undesired activities or can lead to de‐anonymization if out‐of‐network information becomes available. In this work, we propose an approach to undermine pseudo‐anonymity of blockchain transactions by linking together addresses that were used to deploy smart contracts, which were produced by the same authors. In our approach, we leverage stylometry techniques, widely used in the social science field for attribution of literary texts to their corresponding authors. The assumption underlying authorship attribution is the existence of a distinctive writing style, unique to an author and easily distinguishable from others. Drawing an analogy between literary text and smart contracts' source code, we explore the extent to which unique features of source code and byte code of Ethereum smart contracts can represent the coding style of smart contract developers. We show that even a small number of representative features leads to a sufficiently high accuracy in attributing smart contracts' code to its deployer's address. We further validate our approach on real‐world scammers' data and Ponzi scheme‐related contracts.

Stylometric analysis of French plays of the 17th century,2024,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqae011,0,"Abstract The automatic assignment of a text to one or more predefined categories presents multiple applications. In this context, the current study focuses on author attribution in which the true author of a doubtful text must be identified. This analysis focuses on the style of sixty-six French comedies in verse written by seventeen supposed authors during the 17th century. The hypothesis we want to verify assumes that the real author is the name appearing on the cover (called the signature hypothesis). In order to validate the reliability of two attribution procedures, we used two additional corpora based on 200 extracts of novels written in French, with thirty authors and 140 Italian novels authored by forty persons.

Code stylometry vs formatting and minification,2024,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2142,0,"The automatic identification of code authors based on their programming styles—known as authorship attribution or code stylometry—has become possible in recent years thanks to improvements in machine learning-based techniques for author recognition. Once feasible at scale, code stylometry can be used for well-intended or malevolent activities, including: identifying the most expert coworker on a piece of code (if authorship information goes missing); fingerprinting open source developers to pitch them unsolicited job offers; de-anonymizing developers of illegal software to pursue them. Depending on their respective goals, stakeholders have an interest in making code stylometry either more or less effective. To inform these decisions we investigate how the accuracy of code stylometry is impacted by two common software development activities: code formatting and code minification. We perform code stylometry on Python code from the Google Code Jam dataset (59 authors) using a code2vec-based author classifier on concrete syntax tree (CST) representations of input source files. We conduct the experiment using both CSTs and ASTs (abstract syntax trees). We compare the respective classification accuracies on: (1) the original dataset, (2) the dataset formatted with Black, and (3) the dataset minified with Python Minifier. Our results show that: (1) CST-based stylometry performs better than AST-based (51.00%→68%), (2) code formatting makes a significant dent (15%) in code stylometry accuracy (68%→53%), with minification subtracting a further 3% (68%→50%). While the accuracy reduction is significant for both code formatting and minification, neither is enough to make developers non-recognizable via code stylometry.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Python (programming language)', 'Disk formatting', 'Source code', 'Code (set theory)', 'Software', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Programming language', 'Operating system', 'Set (abstract data type)']","['Stefano Balla', 'Maurizio Gabbrielli', 'Stefano Zacchiroli']",35,True,PeerJ Computer Science,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
"Blogs, Twitter Feeds, and Reddit Comments: Cross-domain Authorship Attribution",2016,https://doi.org/10.1515/popets-2016-0021,57,"Abstract Stylometry is a form of authorship attribution that relies on the linguistic information to attribute documents of unknown authorship based on the writing styles of a suspect set of authors. This paper focuses on the cross-domain subproblem where the known and suspect documents differ in the setting in which they were created. Three distinct domains, Twitter feeds, blog entries, and Reddit comments, are explored in this work. We determine that state-of-the-art methods in stylometry do not perform as well in cross-domain situations (34.3% accuracy) as they do in in-domain situations (83.5% accuracy) and propose methods that improve performance in the cross-domain setting with both feature and classification level techniques which can increase accuracy to up to 70%. In addition to testing these approaches on a large real world dataset, we also examine real world adversarial cases where an author is actively attempting to hide their identity. Being able to identify authors across domains facilitates linking identities across the Internet making this a key security and privacy concern; users can take other measures to ensure their anonymity, but due to their unique writing style, they may not be as anonymous as they believe.","['Stylometry', 'Suspect', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Domain (mathematical analysis)', 'Anonymity', 'Adversarial system', 'Attribution', 'Social media', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'The Internet', 'Identity (music)', 'Writing style', 'Data science', 'Key (lock)', 'Information retrieval', 'Internet privacy', 'World Wide Web', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Criminology', 'Acoustics', 'Programming language']","['Rebekah Overdorf', 'Rachel Greenstadt']",29,True,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Statistics of Numerals in Authorial Texts and Stylometry,2020,https://doi.org/10.20431/2347-3142.0805003,1,"Two approaches to the statistical analysis of texts are suggested, both based on the study of numerals occurring in coherent literary texts.The first approach is related to the study of the frequency distribution of various leading digits of numerals occurring in the text.These frequencies are unequal: the digit 1 is strongly dominating; usually, the incidence of subsequent digits is monotonically decreasing.The frequencies of occurrence of the digit 1, as well as, to a lesser extent, the digits 2 and 3, are usually a characteristic author's style feature, manifested in all (sufficiently long) literary texts of any author.This approach is convenient for testing whether a group of texts has common authorship: the latter is dubious if the frequency distributions are sufficiently different.The second approach is the extension of the first one and requires the study of the frequency distribution of numerals themselves (not their leading digits).The approach yields non-trivial information about the author, stylistic and genre peculiarities of the texts and is suited for the advanced discourse analysis.A.

Evaluating Author Attribution on Emirati Tweets,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3016731,2,"Author Attribution (AA) is a critical stylometry problem that tries to deduce the identity of the authors of electronic texts (e-texts) by only examining the texts. AA is essential for enhancing various application domains, such as recommender systems and forensics. Nevertheless, existing techniques in AA have not been assessed with Emirati social media e-texts. The reason is that no suitable dataset exists for evaluating AA techniques in this context.

From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to Hildegard is fascinating. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language of which she did not master all grammatical subtleties. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. Especially Hildegard's last collaborator, Guibert of Gembloux, seems to have considerably reworked her works during his secretaryship. Whereas her other scribes were only allowed to make superficial linguistic changes, Hildegard would have permitted Guibert to render her language stylistically more elegant. In this article, we focus on two shorter texts: the Visio ad Guibertum missa and Visio de Sancto Martino, both of which Hildegard allegedly authored during Guibert's secretaryship. We analyze a corpus containing the letter collections of Hildegard, Guibert, and Bernard of Clairvaux using a number of common stylometric techniques. We discuss our results in the light of the Synergy Hypothesis, suggesting that texts resulting from collaboration can display a style markedly different from that of the collaborating authors.

Text Classification for Authorship Attribution Using Naive Bayes Classifier with Limited Training Data,2014,,38,"Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying authors of disputed or anonymous texts. It can be seen as a single, multi-class text classification task. It is concerned with writing style rather than topic matter. The scalability issue in traditional AA studies concerns the effect of data size, the amount of data per candidate author. This has not been probed in much depth yet, since most stylometry researches tend to focus on long texts per author or multiple short texts, because stylistic choices frequently occur less in such short texts. This paper investigates the task of authorship attribution on short historical Arabic texts written by10 different authors. Several experiments are conducted on these texts by extracting various lexical and character features of the writing style of each author, using N-grams word level (1,2,3, and 4) and character level (1,2,3, and 4) grams as a text representation. Then Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is employed in order to classify the texts to their authors. This is to show robustness of NB classifier in doing AA on very short-sized texts when compared to Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using dataset (called AAAT) which consists of 3 short texts per author’s book, it is shown our method is at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) for the selection of the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the significance of punctuation marks is explored in order to distinguish between authors, showing that an increase in the performance can be achieved. As well, the NB classifier achieved high accuracy results. Since the experiments of AA task that are done on AAAT dataset show interesting results with a classification accuracy of the best score obtained up to 96% using N-gram word level 1gram.

Adversarial Authorship Attribution for Deobfuscation,2022,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.509,3,"Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled powerful privacy-invasive authorship attribution. To counter authorship attribution, researchers have proposed a variety of rule-based and learning-based text obfuscation approaches. However, existing authorship obfuscation approaches do not consider the adversarial threat model. Specifically, they are not evaluated against adversarially trained authorship attributors that are aware of potential obfuscation. To fill this gap, we investigate the problem of adversarial authorship attribution for deobfuscation. We show that adversarially trained authorship attributors are able to degrade the effectiveness of existing obfuscators from 20-30% to 5-10%. We also evaluate the effectiveness of adversarial training when the attributor makes incorrect assumptions about whether and which obfuscator was used. While there is a a clear degradation in attribution accuracy, it is noteworthy that this degradation is still at or above the attribution accuracy of the attributor that is not adversarially trained at all.

An Optimal Feature Set for Stylometry-based Style Change detection at Document and Sentence Level,2022,https://doi.org/10.32628/cseit228617,1,"Writing style change detection models focus on determining the number of authors of documents with or without known authors. Determining the exact number of authors contributing in writing a document particularly when the authors contribute short texts in form of a sentence is still challenging because of the lack of standardized feature sets able to discriminate between the works of authors. Therefore, the task of identifying the best feature set for all the tasks of the writing style change detection is still considered important. This paper sought to determine the best feature set for the writing style change detection tasks; separating documents with several style changes (multi-authorship) from documents without any style changes (single-authorship), and determining the number and location of style changes in the case of multi-authorship. We performed exploratory research on existing stylometric features to determine the best document level and sentence level features. Document level features were extracted and used to separate single authored from multi-authored documents, while sentence level features were used to answer the question of determining the number of style changes To answer this question, we trained a random forest classifier to rank document level features and sentence level features separately, and applied an ablation test on the top 15 sentence level features using k-means clustering algorithm to confirm the effect of these features on model performance. The study found out that the best document level feature set for separating documents with and without style change was provided by an ensemble of features including number of sentence repetitions (num_sentence_repetitions) as the most determinant feature, 5-grams, 4-grams, Special_character, sentence_begin_lower, sentence_begin_upper, diversity, automated_readability_index, parenthesis_count, first_word_uppercase, lensear_write_formula, dale_chall_readability, difficult_words, type_token_ratio","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Sentence', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Writing style', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Programming language']","['Vivian Anyango Oloo', 'Lilian Wanzare', 'Calvins Otieno']",24,True,International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Authorship attribution for textual data on online social networks,2017,https://doi.org/10.1109/ic3.2017.8284311,8,"Authorship Attribution, (AA) is a process of determining a particular document is written by which author among a list of suspected authors. Authorship attribution has been the problem from last six decades; when there were handwritten documents needed to be identified for the genuine author. Due to the technology advancement and increase in cybercrime and unlawful activities, this problem of AA becomes forth most important to trace out the author behind online messages. Over the past, many years research has been conducted to attribute the authorship of an author on the basis of their writing style as all authors possess different distinctiveness while writing a piece of document. This paper presents a comparative study of various machine learning approaches on different feature sets for authorship attribution on short text. The Twitter dataset has been used for comparison with varying sample size of a dataset of 10 prolific authors with various combinations of feature sets. The significance and impact of combinations of features while inferring different stylometric features has been reflected. The results of different approaches are compared based on their accuracy and precision values.","['Authorship attribution', 'Optimal distinctiveness theory', 'Computer science', 'TRACE (psycholinguistics)', 'Attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Information retrieval', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Writing style', 'Process (computing)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Sample (material)', 'Natural language processing', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Chemistry', 'Archaeology', 'Chromatography', 'Psychotherapist', 'History', 'Operating system']","['Ritu Banga', 'Pulkit Mehndiratta']",23,False,,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
A Complex Network Approach to Stylometry,2015,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136076,78,"Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.","['Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Complement (music)', 'Complex system', 'Complex network', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language', 'Machine learning', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Topology (electrical circuits)', 'Mathematics', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Combinatorics', 'Complementation', 'World Wide Web', 'Gene', 'Phenotype']",['Diego R.

An interesting fact is that a number of cases were found with evidence that points to the falsification of texts and someone's authorship. Proofing authorship dispute cases in Indonesia has not reached an analysis of authorship, because of the difficulty of identifying personal identity in electronic texts, especially in short texts with limited characters and words. This study examines Indonesian text set to investigate and describe linguistic profiles based on N-gram analysis and style characteristics. The data source in this study is Corpora of electronic text sets from 50 unique authors, including 8 authors and evidence from criminal cases, which are limited to 2000 characters or 500 words. All texts are personal texts that are collected from volunteers and case documents that are permitted to be accessed. Data analysis was carried out by determining and calculating the n-grams, both on the character-level and word-level, and performing stylometric features that the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library extracts. The results of the data analysis show that lexically, the character-level n-gram analysis, as the smallest n-unit, shows an important element of authorship attribution, such as the use of alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, capitalization, and punctuation. Diction is a significant factor to identify the author's profile and distinguish between one author and another.

Investigating the Linguistic Fingerprint of GPT-4o in Arabic-to-English Translation Using Stylometry,2024,https://doi.org/10.48185/jtls.v5i3.1343,0,"This study explores the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of machine-generated texts, focusing on the output of GPT-4o. Using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including word frequency and stopword count analysis, readability and sentence structure metrics, lexical diversity measures, syntactic frequency analysis, and named entity recognition (NER), the research aims to uncover the stylometric fingerprints present in machine-generated content. The results reveal that GPT-4ogenerated texts exhibit moderate lexical diversity and syntactic complexity, with certain chapters reflecting higher readability and more varied sentence structures, while others lean toward simpler linguistic patterns. The findings also highlight thematic variation across chapters, as observed in the distribution of named entities, which contributes to understanding the model’s handling of different contextual content. The research suggests that while GPT-4o maintains a consistent style in its generated text, there are distinguishable characteristics that may serve as indicators of machine authorship. This provides valuable insights for stylometric analysis, authorship attribution, and the identification of machine-generated texts in various contexts. Future research could extend this work by exploring deeper stylometric features, conducting cross-model comparisons, and developing advanced authorship detection algorithms tailored for AI-generated content.

Inspired by the success of modern automatic document classification problem, some researchers followed the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) approach for authenticating long documents. In this work, we consider both approaches and their application on authenticating tweets, which represent additional challenges due to the limitation in their sizes. We focus on the Arabic language due to its importance and the scarcity of works related on it.

E-mail authorship attribution using customized associative classification,2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2015.05.012,36,"E-mail communication is often abused for conducting social engineering attacks including spamming, phishing, identity theft and for distributing malware.

The developed model is employed to identify the most plausible writer of the text. Unfortunately, most existing studies focus solely on improving predictive accuracy and not on the inherent value of the evidence collected. In this study, we propose a customized associative classification technique, a popular data mining method, to address the authorship attribution problem.

Stylometric Anonymity: Is Imitation the Best Strategy?,2015,https://doi.org/10.1109/trustcom.2015.472,1,"Stylometry analysis of given electronic texts can allow for the extraction of information about their authors by analyzing the stylistic choices the authors make to write their texts. Such extracted information could be the identity of suspect authors or their profile attributes such as their gender, age group, ethnicity group, etc. Therefore, when preserving the anonymity of an author is critical, such as that of a whistle blower, it is important to ensure the stylistic anonymity of the conveyed text itself in addition to anonymizing communication channels (e.g. Tor, or the minimization of application fingerprints). Currently, only two stylistic anonymization strategies are known, namely: imitation and obfuscation attacks. A long-term objective is to find automated methods that reliably transform given input texts such that the output texts maximize author anonymity while, reasonably, preserving the semantics of the input texts. Before one proceeds with such long-term objective, it is important to first identify effective strategies that maximize stylistic anonymity. The current state of the literature implies that imitation attacks are better at preserving the anonymity of authors than obfuscation. However, we argue that such evaluations are limited and should not generalize to stylistic anonymity as they were only executed against AA solvers, a closed-set problem. In this study, we extend such evaluations against state-of-the-art AV solvers, an open-set problem. Our results show that imitation attacks degrade the classification accuracy of AV solvers more aggressively than that of AA solvers. We argue that such reduction in accuracy below random chance guessing renders imitation attacks as inferior strategies relative to obfuscation attacks. Furthermore, as we present a general formal notation of stylometry problems, we conjecture that the same observations apply to all stylometry problems (AA, AV, AP, SI).","['Anonymity', 'Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Obfuscation', 'Imitation', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Suspect', 'Identity (music)', 'Term (time)', 'State (computer science)', 'Scheme (mathematics)', 'Computer security', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Algorithm', 'Mathematics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Political science', 'Acoustics', 'Law', 'Programming language']","['Mahmoud Khonji', 'Youssef Iraqi']",14,False,2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

This article applies stylometry, the computational method of analysing style, to the oeuvres of 10 Dutch and English crosswriters to trace potential differences in their individual style and similarities between the authors. The analyses also take into account the age of the intended reader (as listed in the paratext) and the publication date, to study the influence these aspects have on writing style. Four case studies zoom in on a specific author or age category of the intended readership to study general tendencies as well as outliers. The results from the stylometric analyses are complemented with peritextual information about the author’s view on style and writing for readerships of different ages. The main conclusion drawn from the case studies is that the style of the texts usually correlates more strongly with the age of the intended reader than with the time period in which it was written. Young adult literature clusters more closely with adult literature.

Stylometry for Medieval Authorship Studies: An Application to Rhyme Words,2012,https://doi.org/10.1353/dph.2012.0002,13,"In the digital humanities much research has been done concerning stylometry, the computational study of style. Literary authorship at-tribution, especially, has been a central topic. After a brief introduction, I will discuss the enormous potential of this paradigm for medieval philology, a field that studies so many texts of unknown or disputed origin. At the same time, it will be stressed that stylometry’s application to medieval texts is currently not without problems: many attribution techniques are still controversial and do not account for the specific nature of medieval text production. Throughout this paper, I will tentatively apply two well-established attribution techniques (principal components analysis and Burrows’s Delta) to a number of case studies in Middle Dutch studies. These analyses shall be restricted to rhyme words, since these words are less likely to have been altered by scribes.","['Stylometry', 'Rhyme', 'Authorship attribution', 'Philology', 'Literature', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Linguistics', 'History', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Poetry', 'Gender studies']",['Mike Kestemont'],37,False,Digital philology,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Computational methods in authorship attribution,2008,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20961,472,"Abstract Statistical authorship attribution has a long history, culminating in the use of modern machine learning classification methods. Nevertheless, most of this work suffers from the limitation of assuming a small closed set of candidate authors and essentially unlimited training text for each. Real‐life authorship attribution problems, however, typically fall short of this ideal. Thus, following detailed discussion of previous work, three scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first variant, the profiling problem, there is no candidate set at all; in this case, the challenge is to provide as much demographic or psychological information as possible about the author. In the second variant, the needle‐in‐a‐haystack problem, there are many thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample. In the third variant, the verification problem, there is no closed candidate set but there is one suspect; in this case, the challenge is to determine if the suspect is or is not the author. For each variant, it is shown how machine learning methods can be adapted to handle the special challenges of that variant.","['Haystack', 'Suspect', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Profiling (computer programming)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Criminology', 'Programming language', 'Operating system']","['Moshe Koppel', 'Jonathan Schler', 'Shlomo Argamon']",114,True,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

CLOSE AND OPEN TASK AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION: A COMPUTATIONAL AUTHORSHIP ANALYSIS,2019,https://doi.org/10.18860/prdg.v2i1.6704,0,"&lt;p&gt;Authorship analysis is one of the areas lies within forensic linguistics where the main task is to investigate the characteristics of a text in terms of its authorship. Specifically, authorship attribution examines the possibility of an author for having written the text by analyzing the author's other works. This experimental research addresses two problems: which author writes which text (using a closed task authorship attribution) and who writes each text (using an open task of authorship attribution). In doing so, this research uses R to do statistical computing employing both stylo() and classify() functions. Based on carried out experiments with 1-grams as a fixed variable, it is concluded that SVM algorithm may be best used in doing closed task authorship attribution for its 100% consistency, whereas for the open task k-NN algorithm may be best used since it reaches 94% consistency. In addition to open class task, stylo() function may perform better than classify() function since stylo() function provides results closer to the actual answer. As the legal system often challenges authorship analysis for not having a valid methodology, analyzing styles using stylometry and measuring the styles computationally may help forensic linguists to provide an adequate analysis for the legal system.

Since there are many ways to define writing style, the result not only depends on the clustering method but even more so on the measure of similarity. With authorship attribution, the predominant application of stylometry, as its benchmark much research has addressed the utility of methods for measuring similarity. We use a corpus of German-language novellas to demonstrate that one may be interested in very different meaningful groups of texts simultaneously, and that these can be recovered from stylometric clustering if the measure is chosen accordingly. As can be expected, different measures do better at recovering groups associated with, for instance, subgenre, author gender, or narrative perspective. As a consequence, it is suggested that corpus analyses should not be based on what is currently considered the most refined measure of stylometric similarity, but rather break down the decisions that yield a specific measure and provide substantively justified arguments for them.","['Stylometry', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Cluster analysis', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Measure (data warehouse)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Novella', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Narrative', 'Similarity measure', 'Task (project management)', 'Benchmark (surveying)', 'Reading (process)', 'Writing style', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Data mining', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Geodesy', 'Economics', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Geography']","['Simon Päpcke', 'Thomas Weitin', 'Katharina Herget', 'Anastasia Glawion', 'Ulrik Brandes']",16,False,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,['Volkswagen Foundation'],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Authorship Attribution in Bangla Literature (AABL) via Transfer Learning using ULMFiT,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3530691,2,"Authorship Attribution is the task of creating an appropriate characterization of text that captures the authors’ writing style to identify the original author of a given piece of text. With increased anonymity on the internet, this task has become increasingly crucial in various security and plagiarism detection fields. Despite significant advancements in other languages such as English, Spanish, and Chinese, Bangla lacks comprehensive research in this field due to its complex linguistic feature and sentence structure. Moreover, existing systems are not scalable with the increasing number of authors, and performance drops with the small number of samples per author. In this paper, we propose the use of Average-Stochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped Long Short-Term Memory (AWD-LSTM) architecture and an effective transfer learning approach that addresses the problem of complex linguistic features extraction and scalability for authorship attribution in Bangla Literature (AABL). We analyze the effect of different tokenization, such as word, sub-word, and character level tokenization, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these tokenizations in the proposed model. Moreover, we introduce the publicly available Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors (BAAD16) containing 17,966 sample texts and 13.4+ million words to solve the standard dataset scarcity problem and release six variations of pre-trained language models for use in any Bangla NLP downstream task.

Empirically, our proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art models and achieved 99.8% accuracy in the BAAD16 dataset.

Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size.

A critique of the raw cladistic methods and an interpretation of the dichotomy-phenomenon are offered. The same methods are applied to 13th century Italian poetry to determine authorship attributions and to verify commonly accepted literary taxonomy. Philology is a human science primarily applied to literary texts and traditionally divided into lower and higher criticism. Lower criticism tries to reconstruct the author’s original text and higher criticism is the study of the authorship, style, and provenance of texts. The use of methods borrowed from information theory makes it possible to bring together methodologically some of the sectors of the two fields. The outcome of the experiments in both text criticism and text attribution has been encouraging. In the former, the tests performed on three different traditions have provided results very similar to those obtained by traditional methods requiring a great amount of time. The experiments carried out both on 13th century Italian poets and schools have shown that it is possible to draw texts closer to one another.

Deception in Authorship Attribution,2013,,4,"In digital forensics, questions often arise about the authors of documents: their identity, demographic background, and whether they can be linked to other documents. The field of stylometry uses linguistic features and machine learning techniques to answer these questions. While stylometry techniques can identify authors with high accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios, their accuracy is reduced to random guessing when faced with authors who intentionally obfuscate their writing style or attempt to imitate that of another author. Most authorship attribution methods were not evaluated in challenging real-world datasets with foreign language and unconventional spelling (e.g. l33tsp3ak). In this thesis we explore the performance of authorship attribution methods in adversarial settings where authors take measures to hide their identity by changing their writing style and by creating multiple identities. We show that using a large feature set, it is possible to distinguish regular documents from deceptive documents with high accuracy and present an analysis of linguistic features that can be modified to hide writing style. We show how to adapt regular authorship attribution to difficult datasets such as leaked underground forum and present a method for detecting multiple identities of authors. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a case study that includes applying our technique to an underground forum and manual analysis to validate the results, enabling the discovery of previously undetected multiple accounts.%%%%Ph.D., Computer Science  – Drexel University, 2013","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Adversarial system', 'Identity (music)', 'Writing style', 'Deception', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Handwriting', 'Data science', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology', 'Acoustics', 'Pure mathematics', 'History', 'Programming language']",['Sadia Afroz'],0,False,,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Stylometric analysis research has been done for author identification and there is significant progress to recognize an author based on their written texts. This paper aims to evaluate the efficiency o f u sing s tylometry a s a fall back authentication method. We proposed to detect differences between writings on the same topic provided by a set of users and tested whether these differences are enough to use for an authentication system. We observed 74% accuracy in detecting the actual authors and concluded that with additional features the accuracy can be pushed to above 90%. Moreover, we deviced a threshold for authentication of a particular user. We observed that the combination of textual features can support authenticity of the user. We also analyzed the impact of some data cleaning systems like removing stop words and punctuation marks, and how they affected the overall detection outcome.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Punctuation', 'Computer science', 'Authentication (law)', 'Identification (biology)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Natural (archaeology)', 'Biometrics', 'Information retrieval', 'Computer security', 'History', 'Botany', 'Archaeology', 'Biology', 'Programming language']","['Nafiz Sadman', 'Kishor Datta Gupta', 'Md Ariful Haque', 'Sajib Sen', 'Subash Poudyal']",17,False,"2022 19th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)",[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Stylometry at the service of history of science: the Renaissance of Copernicus,2024,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqae085,0,"Abstract A recent study, following a subtle but unusual for history of science argumentation method starting from the premises established by stylometry, discovered a drastic stylistic contrast between Copernicus’s early opus Commentariolus and his mature writings. The finding challenged the long-established view that Copernicus became a humanistically minded scholar early in his life and composed Commentariolus between 1509 and 1514. The present study verifies and extends this investigation by analyzing the whole extant literary oeuvre of Copernicus. The stylometric investigation for the most critical stylistic markers is followed by a detailed linguistic analysis. The results allow for convincing guesses on what motivated Copernicus to abruptly change his Latin style and establish the circumstances under which Copernicus most likely fully embraced Renaissance humanism. In addition, the subsequent historiographical analysis presents a plausible hypothesis on the precise dating of Commentariolus, the “birth certificate” of Copernicus’s geokinetic cosmology. Thus, the utility of stylometry for the history of science is demonstrated.","['Copernicus', 'Stylometry', 'The Renaissance', 'Humanism', 'Historiography', 'Argumentation theory', 'Greeks', 'Philosophy', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Literature', 'Epistemology', 'Classics', 'History', 'Art history', 'Art', 'Linguistics', 'Archaeology', 'Theology', 'Physics', 'Astronomy']",['George Borski'],10,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Conversationally-inspired stylometric features for authorship attribution in instant messaging,2012,https://doi.org/10.1145/2393347.2396398,51,"Authorship attribution (AA) aims at recognizing automatically the author of a given text sample. Traditionally applied to literary texts, AA faces now the new challenge of recognizing the identity of people involved in chat conversations. These share many aspects with spoken conversations, but AA approaches did not take it into account so far. Hence, this paper tries to fill the gap and proposes two novelties that improve the effectiveness of traditional AA approaches for this type of data: the first is to adopt features inspired by Conversation Analysis (in particular for turn-taking), the second is to extract the features from individual turns rather than from entire conversations. The experiments have been performed over a corpus of dyadic chat conversations (77 individuals in total).

A Scientometric Study of the Stylometric Research Field,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/informatics9030060,6,"Stylometry has gained great popularity in digital humanities and social sciences. Many works on stylometry have recently been reported. However, there is a research gap regarding review studies in this field from a bibliometric and evolutionary perspective. Therefore, in this paper, a bibliometric analysis of publications from the Scopus database in the stylometric research field was proposed. Then, research articles published between 1968 and 2021 were collected and analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package for bibliometric analysis via the Biblioshiny web interface. Empirical results were also presented in terms of the performance analysis and the science mapping analysis. From these results, it is concluded that there has been a strong growth in stylometry research in recent years, while the USA, Poland, and the UK are the most productive countries, and this is due to many strong research partnerships. It was also concluded that the research topics of most articles, based on author keywords, focused on two broad thematic categories: (1) the main tasks in stylometry and (2) methodological approaches (statistics and machine learning methods).","['Stylometry', 'Popularity', 'Scopus', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Web of science', 'Data science', 'Bibliometrics', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Scientometrics', 'Computer science', 'Library science', 'Political science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Mathematics', 'MEDLINE', 'Law', 'Pure mathematics']",['Panagiotis D.

The purpose of this study is to explore and evaluate the use of stylometric analysis, a quantitative analysis for the linguistics features of text, to support the task of automated text genre detection for Classical Arabic text. Design/methodology/approach Unsupervised clustering and supervised classification were applied on the King Saud University Corpus of Classical Arabic texts (KSUCCA) using the most frequent words in the corpus (MFWs) as stylometric features. Four popular distance measures established in stylometric research are evaluated for the genre detection task. Findings The results of the experiments show that stylometry-based genre clustering and classification align well with human-defined genre. The evidence suggests that genre style signals exist for Classical Arabic and can be used to support the task of automated genre detection. Originality/value This work targets the task of genre detection in Classical Arabic text using stylometric features, an approach that has only been previously applied to Arabic authorship attribution.

Computational Stylometic Approach Based on Frequent Word and Frequent Pair in the Text Mining Authorship Attribution,2009,,4,"Summary Stylometric Authorship attribution is one of the new approaches in the text mining field that has been showing recently because of its delicateness. This approach is concerned about analyzing texts, e.g. Novels and plays that famous authors wrote, trying to measure the author style, by choosing some attributes that shows the author style of writing, assuming that these writers have a special way of writing, that no other writer has. To achieve that, this paper discusses several algorithms which are used frequently and skipping the one time, ad-hoc adventures in this field. This paper is also opens the way for future works to merge and improve these techniques by showing experimentally the accuracy level of using both frequent words and frequent word pair depending on the computational approach.","['Authorship attribution', 'Merge (version control)', 'Computer science', 'Writing style', 'Word (group theory)', 'Natural language processing', 'Stylometry', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Adventure', 'Attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Data science', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Social psychology', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Pure mathematics']","['Tareef Kamil Mustafa', 'Aida Mustapha', 'Masrah Azrifah Azmi Murad', 'Masrah Azrifah Azmi Murad']",8,False,,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Advances in Distant Diplomatics: A Stylometric Approach to Medieval Charters,2021,https://doi.org/10.54103/interfaces-08-10,1,"The quantitative analysis of writing style (stylometry) is becoming an increasingly common research instrument in philology. When it comes to medieval texts, such a methodology might be able to help us disentangle the multiple authorial strata that can often be discerned in them (issuer, dictator, scribe, etc.). To deliver a proof of concept in 'distant diplomatics,' we have turned to a corpus of twelfth-century Latin charters from the Cambrai episcopal chancery. We subjected this collection to an (unsupervised) stylometric modelling procedure, based on lexical frequency extraction and dimension reduction. In the absence of a sizable 'ground truth' for this material, we zoomed in on a specific case study, namely the oeuvre of the previously identified dictator-scribe known as 'RogF/JeanE.' Our results offer additional support for the attribution of a diplomatic oeuvre to this individual and even allow us to enlarge it with additional documents. Our analysis moreover yielded the serendipitous discovery of another, previously unnoticed, oeuvre, which we tentatively attribute to a scribe-dictator 'JeanB.' We conclude that the large-scale stylometric analysis is a promising methodology for digital diplomatics.

Arabic Authorship Attribution,2018,https://doi.org/10.1145/3236391,22,"Law enforcement faces problems in tracing the true identity of offenders in cybercrime investigations. Most offenders mask their true identity, impersonate people of high authority, or use identity deception and obfuscation tactics to avoid detection and traceability. To address the problem of anonymity, authorship analysis is used to identify individuals by their writing styles without knowing their actual identities. Most authorship studies are dedicated to English due to its widespread use over the Internet, but recent cyber-attacks such as the distribution of Stuxnet indicate that Internet crimes are not limited to a certain community, language, culture, ideology, or ethnicity. To effectively investigate cybercrime and to address the problem of anonymity in online communication, there is a pressing need to study authorship analysis of languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, and so on. Arabic, the focus of this study, is the fourth most widely used language on the Internet. This study investigates authorship of Arabic discourse/text, especially tiny text, Twitter posts. We benchmark the performance of a profile-based approach that uses n -grams as features and compare it with state-of-the-art instance-based classification techniques. Then we adapt an event-visualization tool that is developed for English to accommodate both Arabic and English languages and visualize the result of the attribution evidence. In addition, we investigate the relative effect of the training set, the length of tweets, and the number of authors on authorship classification accuracy. Finally, we show that diacritics have an insignificant effect on the attribution process and part-of-speech tags are less effective than character-level and word-level n -grams.","['Cybercrime', 'Computer science', 'Anonymity', 'Authorship attribution', 'The Internet', 'Identity (music)', 'Cyberspace', 'Online identity', 'Stylometry', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer security', 'World Wide Web', 'Physics', 'Acoustics']","['Malik H.

Style-markers in authorship attribution : a cross-language study of the authorial fingerprint,2011,,65,"The present study addresses one of the theoretical problems of computer-assisted authorship attribution, namely the question which traceable features of language can betray authorial uniqueness (a stylistic fingerprint) of literary texts. A number of recent approaches show that apart from lexical measures — especially those relying on the frequencies of the most frequent words — also some other features of written language are considerably effective as discriminators of authorial style. However, there have been no attempts to compare the attribution potential of these features. The aim of the present study, then, was to examine the effectiveness of several style-markers in authorship attribution. The style-markers chosen for the empirical investigation are those that can be retrieved from a non-lemmatized corpus of plain text files, such as the most frequent words, word bi-grams, different letter sequences, and markers of different nature, combined in one sample. Equally important, however, was to compare usefulness of the chosen style-markers across a few languages: English, Polish, German, and Latin. The results confirmed a high attribution effectiveness of word-based style-markers in the English corpus, but the alternative markers are shown to be usually more effective in the other languages.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'German', 'Linguistics', 'Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Writing style', 'Natural language processing', 'Fingerprint (computing)', 'Word (group theory)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy']",['Maciej Eder'],27,False,Studies in Polish Linguistics,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

A Stylometric Analysis of the Multi-Authored 'Vita' of Hildegard of Bingen,2021,https://doi.org/10.54103/interfaces-08-08,1,"This article explores by aid of stylometric methods the collaborative authorship of the Vita Hildegardis, Hildegard of Bingen's (auto-?)biography. Both Hildegard and her biographers gradually contributed to the text in the course of the last years of Hildegard's life, and it was posthumously completed in the mid-1180s by end redactor Theoderic of Echternach. In between these termini a quo and ante quem the work was allegedly taken up but left unfinished by secretaries Godfrey of Disibodenberg and Guibert of Gembloux. In light of the fact that the Vita is an indispensable source in gaining historical knowledge on Hildegard's life, the question has often been raised whether the Life of Hildegard is – by dint of contributions by multiple stakeholders – a larger-than-life depiction of the visionary's life course. Specifically the 'autobiographical' passages included in the Vita, in which Hildegard is allegedly cited directly and is taken to recount biographical information in the first-person singular, have been approached with suspicion. By applying state-of-the-art computional methods for the automatic detection of writing style (stylometry), the delicate questions of authenticity and collaborative authorship of this (auto?)hagiographical text are addressed.","['Stylometry', 'Depiction', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Chivalry', 'Art history', 'Philosophy', 'Linguistics']",['Jeroen De Gussem'],28,True,Interfaces A Journal of Medieval European Literatures,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Our research mainly focuses on scientific publications, because scholarly journals are publicly available with plenty of labeled data to learn an author's style or traits. The main challenge of authorship de-identification is to identify features which can properly capture an author's writing style. In the proposed design, we choose a combination of stylometric features, including lexical, syntactic, structural and content-specific features, to represent each author's style and use them to build classification models. We manually collect publications from computer science and biomedicine domains and validate our designs by using a number of classification methods.

A Stylometric Analysis of Ljósvetninga saga,2020,https://doi.org/10.33112/gripla.31.1,1,"Ljósvetninga saga is preserved in two primary versions, the A-redaction and C-redaction. These two redactions feature parallel (though not identical) sections as well as a section (chapters 13–18) which is entirely divergent. Scholars and editors have long disagreed over the question of which version of the saga is more internally consistent. Two stylistic studies by Adolfine Erichsen in 1919 and Hallvard Magerøy in 1956 arrived at opposite conclusions: the former preferring the stylistic coherence of the C-redaction and the latter preferring the A-redaction. The conclusions of these scholars reflected opposing stances on the Freeprose-Bookprose origin of the Íslendingasögur. Proponents of the Freeprose school including Knut Liestøl leveraged Erichsen’s stylistic investigation to argue that the divergent section in A-redaction should be considered a genuine oral variant, whereas proponents of the Bookprose school (including the editor of the saga’s Íslenzk fornrit edition, Björn Sigfússon) criticized the oral understanding and instead framed the divergent C-redaction section as a historical novelization of what was originally the A-redaction. The development of stylometry in recent years has provided us with a statistically-robust set of methods to interrogate the style of texts. In this article, the authors revisit the debate and present stylometric evidence to support Erichsen’s conclusion and reject Magerøy’s: the divergent section of the C-redaction has more in common with the parallel chapters and the A-redaction is likely an independent version of the text retold, possibly with recourse to oral tradition.","['Redaction', 'Section (typography)', 'Stylometry', 'CLARITY', 'Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Computer science', 'Mathematics', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Statistics', 'Operating system']","['Michael MacPherson', 'Yoav Tirosh']",11,True,Gripla,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Register variation explains stylometric authorship analysis,2023,https://doi.org/10.1515/cllt-2022-0040,8,"Abstract For centuries, investigations of disputed authorship have shown that people have unique styles of writing. Given sufficient data, it is generally possible to distinguish between the writings of a small group of authors, for example, through the multivariate analysis of the relative frequencies of common function words. There is, however, no accepted explanation for why this type of stylometric analysis is successful. Authorship analysts often argue that authors write in subtly different dialects, but the analysis of individual words is not licensed by standard theories of sociolinguistic variation. Alternatively, stylometric analysis is consistent with standard theories of register variation. In this paper, I argue that stylometric methods work because authors write in subtly different registers. To support this claim, I present the results of parallel stylometric and multidimensional register analyses of a corpus of newspaper articles written by two columnists. I demonstrate that both analyses not only distinguish between these authors but identify the same underlying patterns of linguistic variation. I therefore propose that register variation, as opposed to dialect variation, provides a basis for explaining these differences and for explaining stylometric analyses of authorship more generally.","['Variation (astronomy)', 'Register (sociolinguistics)', 'Stylometry', 'Newspaper', 'Computer science', 'Linguistics', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Astrophysics', 'Media studies']",['Jack Grieve'],38,True,Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Development of the quantitative method for automated text content authorship attribution based on the statistical analysis of N-grams distribution,2019,https://doi.org/10.15587/1729-4061.2019.186834,9,"The peculiarities of the application of linguo-statistics technologies for the identification of the style of the author of text content of scientific and technical profile are considered. Quantitative linguistic analysis of a text uses the benefits of content monitoring based on the NLP methods to identify and analyze the set of stop words, keywords, set phrases and to study N-gram. The latter are used in the linguometry methods to determine in per cent if the given text belongs to a particular author. The quantitative method for automatic text content authorship attribution was developed based on statistical analysis of the 3-gram distribution. The approach to the implementation of identification of the author of the text in the Ukrainian language of the scientific and technical profile was proposed. Experimental results of the proposed method to determine the belonging of the analyzed text to a specific author in the presence of the reference text were obtained. Application of the linguo-statistical analysis of the 3-grams to a set of articles will make it possible to form a subset of publications that are similar in linguistic descriptions. Imposing additional conditions in the form of statistical and quantitative analyses (a set of keywords, set expressions, stylometric, linguometric analyses, etc.) on a subset will allow a significant reduction of this subset by specifying the list of the most likely author. For qualitative and effective content analysis when determining the degree of authorship of a particular author, we propose to analyze the reference text and the one under consideration at several stages: linguometric analysis of the coefficients of the diversity of the author's speech, stylometric analysis, analysis of set expressions, linguo-statistical analysis of 3-grams.

Towards Improving Code Stylometry Analysis in Underground Forums,2021,https://doi.org/10.2478/popets-2022-0007,3,"Abstract Code Stylometry has emerged as a powerful mechanism to identify programmers. While there have been significant advances in the field, existing mechanisms underperform in challenging domains. One such domain is studying the provenance of code shared in underground forums, where code posts tend to have small or incomplete source code fragments. This paper proposes a method designed to deal with the idiosyncrasies of code snippets shared in these forums. Our system fuses a forum-specific learning pipeline with Conformal Prediction to generate predictions with precise confidence levels as a novelty. We see that identifying unreliable code snippets is paramount to generate high-accuracy predictions, and this is a task where traditional learning settings fail. Overall, our method performs as twice as well as the state-of-the-art in a constrained setting with a large number of authors (i.e., 100). When dealing with a smaller number of authors (i.e., 20), it performs at high accuracy (89%).

In this work, we adapt existing stylometric features and develop a new authorship verification model applicable for continuous authentication.

The text is transformed into a network, where words become nodes and their adjacencies in a sentence are represented through links. Motifs of size 3 are then extracted from this network and their distribution is used as a signature for the corresponding translator.

The Federalist Revisited: New Directions in Authorship Attribution,1995,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/10.2.111,274,"The Federalist Papers, twelve of which are claimed by both Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, have long been used as a testing-ground for authorship attribution techniques despite the fact that the styles of Hamilton and Madison are unusually similar. This paper assesses the value of three novel stylometric techniques by applying them to the Federalist problem. The techniques examined are a multivariate approach to vocabulary richness, analysis of the frequencies of occurrence of sets of common high-frequency words, and use of a machine-learning package based on a ‘genetic algorithm’ to seek relational expressions characterizing authorial styles.

An experiment in authorship attribution,2002,,134,"This paper reports an experiment in authorship attribution that reveals considerable authorial structure in texts written by authors with very similar background and training, with genre and topic being strictly controlled for. We interpret our results as supporting the hypothesis that authors have ’ textual fingerprints’, at least for texts produced by authors who are not consciously changing their style of writing across texts. What this study has also taught us is that discriminant analysis is a more appropriate technique to use than principal components analysis when predicting the authorship of an unknown (held-out) text on the basis of known (training) texts of which the authorial provenance is available. Finally, standard discriminant analysis can be enhanced considerably by using an entropy-based weighting scheme of the kind used in latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998).","['Authorship attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Latent semantic analysis', 'Linear discriminant analysis', 'Stylometry', 'Weighting', 'Linguistics', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Medicine', 'Archaeology', 'Radiology']","['R.

Doppelgänger Finder: Taking Stylometry to the Underground,2014,https://doi.org/10.1109/sp.2014.21,99,"Stylometry is a method for identifying anonymous authors of anonymous texts by analyzing their writing style. While stylometric methods have produced impressive results in previous experiments, we wanted to explore their performance on a challenging dataset of particular interest to the security research community. Analysis of underground forums can provide key information about who controls a given bot network or sells a service, and the size and scope of the cybercrime underworld. Previous analyses have been accomplished primarily through analysis of limited structured metadata and painstaking manual analysis. However, the key challenge is to automate this process, since this labor intensive manual approach clearly does not scale. We consider two scenarios. The first involves text written by an unknown cybercriminal and a set of potential suspects. This is standard, supervised stylometry problem made more difficult by multilingual forums that mix l33t-speak conversations with data dumps. In the second scenario, you want to feed a forum into an analysis engine and have it output possible doppelgangers, or users with multiple accounts. While other researchers have explored this problem, we propose a method that produces good results on actual separate accounts, as opposed to data sets created by artificially splitting authors into multiple identities. For scenario 1, we achieve 77% to 84% accuracy on private messages. For scenario 2, we achieve 94% recall with 90% precision on blogs and 85.18% precision with 82.14% recall for underground forum users.

Stylometrics of artwork: uses and limitations,2010,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.838849,10,"A number of digital image analysis techniques have been developed in recent years to address art historical questions. These techniques allow non-destructive analyses of art images that can target outstanding problems of attribution, historical ordering, and other stylistic dimensions. However, great care must be taken in designing the comparisons to which these techniques are applied. In this paper, we review recent work by our lab and by others aimed at establishing a toolbox of stylometrics, and we discuss some of the uses and limitations of these methods. We describe a technique that provides robust classification of authentic drawings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and we demonstrate new techniques for art historical analysis applied to the works of other masters. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of two low-level statistics (the slope of the log amplitude spectrum and color histogram correlation) to analyze the works of Picasso and Braque. Finally, we show that face detection and recognition techniques may play a useful role in the attribution of works of art. The rationale for employing vision coding-like methods (e.g., sparse coding) in stylometry is also reviewed. We conclude that generic authentication tools are unlikely to provide reliable stylometric predictions but that with careful construction of comparison sets - which we believe must be done in close collaboration with art historians - these techniques provide important predictions that can be weighed against other art historical evidence. We argue further that concurrent predictions derived from analysis of many independent dimensions of image data (e.g., color, luminance, and spatial statistics) provide the strongest evidence for digital stylometric determinations.","['Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Toolbox', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Histogram', 'Coding (social sciences)', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Programming language']","['James M.

Significantly better results, however, can be obtained using a new visualization technique, which combines the idea of nearest neighborhood derived from cluster analysis, the idea of hammering out a clustering consensus from bootstrap consensus trees, with the idea of mapping textual similarities onto a form of a network.

In this paper, we present Sundae, a novel code de-anonymization framework that integrates both static and dynamic stylometry analysis. Compared with the existing solutions, Sundae departs in significant ways: (i) it requires much less number of static, hand-crafted features; (ii) it requires much less labeled data for training; and (iii) it can be readily extended to new programmers once their stylometry information becomes available Through extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Sundae delivers strong empirical performance. For example, under the setting of 229 programmers and 9 problems, it outperforms the state-of-art method by a margin of 45.65% on Python code de-anonymization.

Consistency and bias in the attribution of attitudes.,1979,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1871,37,"This article is based on the proposition that people attribute a disposition to an actor by evaluating its consistency with other information about the actor or the situation. This strategy is assumed to be accompanied by a cognitive set or bias to view ambiguous information as consistent with the hypothesized disposition. Respondents were told that a student had chosen or had been assigned to write a proabortion or antiabortion paper, and they were or were not given an ambiguous description of the author's personality. In support of predictions, under choice conditions attitudes were always attributed in accordance with the paper's position, but under assignment conditions such attributions occurred only when respondents received the ambiguous personality description. A central focus of attribution theory is the extent to which an actor's behavior provides information about his or her stable underlying dispositions (cf. Ajzen, 1971; Jones & Davis, 1965; Steiner, 1970). Most analyses of the attribution process (e.g., Heider, 1958; Jones & Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967) have likened observers to naive scientists who, except for a few motivational biases, make systematic use of the information available to them. It has recently been suggested, however, that instead of using sophisticated information-processing strategies, people rely on rather simple intuitive heuristics (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) or cognitive scripts (Abelson, 1976) in making their judgments (see Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1977, for a review).

This paper considers the various attempts that have been made to synthesise behavioural approaches with other theoretical frameworks in order to understand better these recurring problems of implementation within educational settings. One prominent psychological perspective that has been relatively neglected from these considerations is that of attribution theory. This paper reports on an interview study of 24 primary age‐range teachers who had successfully adopted a behavioural approach to a difficult pupil in consultation with an educational psychologist (EP). An analysis is made of these teachers’ attributions for the origins of the pupils’ behaviour and for the improvements that are achieved. The results indicate that different models of attribution are applied by the teachers to the pupils, parents and themselves, suggesting that for sustained and generalisable improvements, EPs may need to take a much more explicit and detailed approach to teachers’ construing of difficult behaviour as well as their actions in response to it.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Pupil', 'Control (management)', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Neuroscience', 'Computer science', 'Management', 'Economics']",['Andy Miller'],28,False,Educational Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The relationship between attributional style and information technology project perception,2008,,0,"The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between attributional style and Information Technology (IT) project perception at varying job responsibility levels. To achieve this thirty participants were recruited from a large government department in the three distinct job responsibility levels of support worker (i.e. individual who undertakes activities under general direction), line manager (i.e. individual who undertakes activities under limited direction and typically performs role of team leader) and executive manager (i.e. individual who undertakes activities that involve a high a level of management skill under broad direction) and interviewed using a modified Work Attributional Style Questionnaire (WASQ) with emergent themes subsequently explored through four focus groups. Based on the research findings all job responsibility levels tend to exhibit an optimistic attributional style that characterises positive work adjustment and self-esteem. However, the attribution of failure to causes that will persist in future projects by all job responsibility levels alongside the attribution of failure to causes that have impacts beyond the project by line and executive managers have the potential to undermine this tendency to exhibit an optimistic attributional style. Reasons for the attribution of failure to causes that have impacts beyond the project include the adverse impact on perceived professionalism by peers following failure, continued inability to influence stakeholders and/or management, strategic impact of the project failure and the daunting complexity of the social and technical challenges at the macro level Whilst the tendency to exhibit an optimistic attributional style by all job responsibility levels is indicative of positive work adjustment and selfesteem, practitioners should be cognisant that individuals exhibiting an optimistic attributional style are less likely to take responsibility for IT project failure (i.e. attribute fai","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Perception', 'Social psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Line management', 'Work (physics)', 'Government (linguistics)', 'Social responsibility', 'Public relations', 'Applied psychology', 'Political science', 'Engineering', 'Mechanical engineering', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'Neuroscience', 'History']",['Eric Kordt'],0,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Authorship attribution of source code by using back propagation neural network based on particle swarm optimization,2017,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187204,49,"Authorship attribution is to identify the most likely author of a given sample among a set of candidate known authors. It can be not only applied to discover the original author of plain text, such as novels, blogs, emails, posts etc., but also used to identify source code programmers. Authorship attribution of source code is required in diverse applications, ranging from malicious code tracking to solving authorship dispute or software plagiarism detection. This paper aims to propose a new method to identify the programmer of Java source code samples with a higher accuracy. To this end, it first introduces back propagation (BP) neural network based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) into authorship attribution of source code. It begins by computing a set of defined feature metrics, including lexical and layout metrics, structure and syntax metrics, totally 19 dimensions. Then these metrics are input to neural network for supervised learning, the weights of which are output by PSO and BP hybrid algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a collected dataset with 3,022 Java files belong to 40 authors. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves 91.060% accuracy. And a comparison with previous work on authorship attribution of source code for Java language illustrates that this proposed method outperforms others overall, also with an acceptable overhead.","['Computer science', 'Source code', 'Particle swarm optimization', 'Java', 'Artificial neural network', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Syntax', 'Code (set theory)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Data mining', 'Plagiarism detection', 'Machine learning', 'Programming language']","['Xinyu Yang', 'Guoai Xu', 'Qi Li', 'Yanhui Guo', 'Miao Zhang']",32,True,PLoS ONE,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Measuring the Value Added of REIT Managers Using MSA Benchmarks: A Return-Based Attribution Analysis Approach,2013,,0,"An interesting, important, and challenging financial question both in academic research and in practice is how to determine asset managers’ investment performance. That is, how much can be attributed to luck or serendipitous timing and how much is skill? In this paper we demonstrate how return-based style analysis, known as attribution analysis, can be used to ascertain the extent to which managers of REITs add value to their firm’s stock returns. Developed by William F. Sharpe, a Nobel Laureate, the attribution analysis technique was originally used to analyze a manager’s investment style based on the individual’s equity portfolio (e.g., large cap growth versus large cap value) by comparing returns on various indices.1 The manager’s style would be inferred according to the extent to which a weighted combination of indices most closely replicated the actual performance of the manager’s portfolio over a specified time period. In this way, a fund manager’s style is determined by finding the mix of indices that provides returns that are the most similar to the manager’s portfolio’s returns. The manager’s performance can then be assessed from the resulting benchmark portfolio, which is constructed using the various indices. The unmanaged benchmark reflects how an investor would do if he or she owned a portfolio comprising the same indices but didn’t have the manager.","['Portfolio', 'Style analysis', 'Investment management', 'Equity (law)', 'Financial economics', 'Economics', 'Stock (firearms)', 'Style investing', 'Investment style', 'Modern portfolio theory', 'Project portfolio management', 'Value (mathematics)', 'Business', 'Actuarial science', 'Econometrics', 'Asset allocation', 'Finance', 'Microeconomics', 'Management', 'Computer science', 'Profit (economics)', 'Return on investment', 'Market liquidity', 'Mechanical engineering', 'Open-ended investment company', 'Machine learning', 'Project management', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Engineering']","['Walter I.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE AT STRESS LEVEL PERCEIVED BY THE PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION,2014,,0,"In this paper we wanted to present the issue of stress perception, depending on the attributional style of people diagnosed with depression and of clinically healthy individuals. Currently, it is believed that emotional experiences, normal oscillations of affection are shown on a continuum between a negative pole- represented by depression and a positive one- euphoria, these oscillations having many nuances within these two poles. Most people are in a state of emotional stability, but in some cases, due to changes to the environment, due to a vulnerability in the personality structure of an individual, this state is disturbed and the emotional experiences can be movable toward one pole or another. Thus, attribution helps us understand our own behavior and that of the people around us. People have a very strong tendency to give and achieve causal attribution for almost any activity they do and for almost any behavior, realizing this at the unconscious level.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Affection', 'Social psychology', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Euphoriant', 'Depression (economics)', 'Unconscious mind', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Macroeconomics', 'Archaeology', 'Neuroscience', 'Economics', 'History']","['Camelia Dindelegan', 'Florina Serac-Popa', 'Gavril Curteanu']",19,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Parent attributional style and early termination from child and parent therapy,2013,,0,"PARENT ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE AND EARLY TERMINATION FROM CHILD AND PARENT THERAPY Ryan J. Mattek, M.A. Marquette University, 2013 Behavior problems are prevalent in young children and represent a threat to a child’s typical development. These early behavior problems are even more common in children from low-income, urban settings. If left untreated, such challenging behaviors may become ingrained and lead to later more severe behaviors including aggression, violence, and anti-social behaviors. Research has demonstrated that participation in child and parent therapy (CPT) programs significantly reduces problematic child behaviors while increasing positive behaviors in both the child and the parent. However, CPT programs report rates of early termination as high as 70%. Research to reduce these early termination rates have historically focused on barriers to treatment including logistical conflicts, race, culture, socioeconomic status, child age, and symptom severity. However, several years of implementing intervention enhancements specifically designed to address these barriers have yielded only moderate and inconsistent results and early termination rates in CPT programs have remained essentially unchanged. More recent research has focused on a new category of barriers to treatment, parent cognitive variables. One such cognitive variable is parental attributions – the spontaneous explanations that parents make to explain the reason for their child’s behaviors. This study examined whether attributional style can predict treatment compliance in a CPT program specifically targeting low-income, urban, minority parents of children with behavior problems. For the study, 425 parents of children with behavior problems completed the Parent Cognition Scale – Adapted (PCS-A) to assess their parent-referent and child-referent attributions at pretest and posttest. Results indicated that parents of children with behavior problems tended to have a more negative attributional style at","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Socioeconomic status', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Aggression', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Population', 'Environmental health']",['Ryan J.

Multi-period Downside Risk Attribution of Observation-driven Investment Strategies,2018,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3242137,0,"Sophisticated algorithmic techniques are complementing human judgement across the fund industry. Whatever the type of rebalancing that occurs in the course of a longer horizon, it probably violates the buy-and-hold assumption. In this article, we develop the methodology to predict, dissect and interpret the h-day financial risk in data-driven portfolios. Our risk budgeting approach is based on a flexible risk factor model that accommodates the dynamics in portfolio composition directly within the risk factors. Once these factors are defined, we cast portfolio risk measures, such as value-at-risk, into an additive mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis format. The simulation study confirms the gains in accuracy compared to the widespread square-root-of-time rule. Our main empirical findings rely on the two-decade performance of a portfolio insurance investment strategy. Rather than looking at total portfolio risk, we conclude that it is more informative to look inside the portfolio.","['Downside risk', 'Attribution', 'Period (music)', 'Investment (military)', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Finance', 'Political science', 'Portfolio', 'Psychology', 'Law', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Politics', 'Acoustics']","['Nabil Bouamara', 'Kris Boudt', 'Jürgen Vandenbroucke']",24,False,SSRN Electronic Journal,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The Correlation between the Attributional Styles and CET-4 Achievement for Non-English Majors,2015,,0,"This study adopts a quantitative approach and seeks to investigate students' attributional styles by using a sample of 328non-English majors from Yanching Institute of Technology in China. Based on the theoretical foundation of Weiner's attribution theory,the study also examines the correlation between students' attributional styles and their CET-4 achievement in an EFL context. The general statistical results of the study indicate that attribution to ability is the most powerful predicator for the self-located successful English learners,while attribution to circumstance is the most powerful predicator for the self-located failures in English learning.

ATTRIBUTION STYLE AND INTERNAL STATE LEXICON: A COMPARISON BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND TYPICAL DEVELOPMENT,2012,https://doi.org/10.33225/ppc/12.02.06,0,"Current theories of intellectual disabilities underlie an approach centred on a more complete description of the development, known as “the whole child approach”, in which emphasis is placed on the reciprocal relationships between the cognitive and motivational dimensions which characterise development. In particular, subjects with intellectual disabilities, who have experienced repeated failures, may develop an attribution profile characterised by a bias towards primarily external causes. However the consideration of internal causes, such as effort and ability, requires the involvement of higher metacognitive and metalinguistic levels. Consequently, attribution to effort requires an awareness of one’s own internal states. The aim of this study is to compare the attribution style and the knowledge of internal states words (physiological, emotional and cognitive) in adolescents with intellectual disability and typical development. Two groups consisting of 14 participants each were employed, an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group was composed by adolescents with intellectual disability. Participants in the control group were matched to the experimental Ss for mental age. All of the 24 participants were given an Attribution Test (Pepi and Alesi, 2001) and a Internal States Lexicon Test (Alesi and Pepi, 2005). The attribution test consisting of 14 items illustrating either everyday or school-related events in which the main character experiences either success or failure. The participants were asked to attribute the character’s performance to one of five causes: ability; effort; help; luck; or task difficulty. On the whole, individuals with intellectual disability tend to attribute mainly performance to external causes such as the ease of the task. Moreover the results show a significant relationship between attribution style and knowledge of internal states words.

"On the Attribution of Parental Competence: Parents’ Behavior Matters, not Their Sexual Orientation",2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-022-02335-9,0,"Abstract Using a vignette approach, two studies examined the impact of three factors on judgments of parental competence: target parents’ sexual orientation, gender, and parenting behavior. According to the aversive prejudice framework, people should express their subtle prejudice against lesbian and gay parents when the latter show detrimental parenting behavior––that is, when devaluation is easy to rationalize. Samples of 170 and 290 German heterosexual participants each were presented with a parent-child conflict situation. In Study 1, the child threw a public tantrum during a restaurant visit; in Study 2, the children wanted to play outside instead of doing their homework. Irrespective of target gender, lesbian and gay parents were judged as equally or even somewhat more competent than heterosexual parents. In both studies, parents who responded in an authoritative way received the most positive evaluation of parental competence, whereas parents who responded in an authoritarian way received the most negative evaluation. In neither study, however, there was a significant interaction between parents’ sexual orientation and parenting behavior. That is, contrary to hypothesis, lesbian and gay parents did not receive more negative evaluation than heterosexual parents when responding in a comparatively negative, authoritarian or permissive way. Such interaction could also not be found when additionally considering participants’ levels of homonegativity or social desirability. The discussion centers on the increasing acceptance of same-sex parenthood as well as the high appreciation of authoritative parenting in contemporary Germany.","['Psychology', 'Sexual orientation', 'Vignette', 'Lesbian', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Authoritarianism', 'Competence (human resources)', 'Permissive', 'Prejudice (legal term)', 'Attribution', 'Conformity', 'Democracy', 'Politics', 'Biology', 'Political science', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Law', 'Genetics']",['Dirk Kranz'],93,True,Journal of Child and Family Studies,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

This study examined cultural differences in revaluative attributions when two potential causes of an outcome are initially present, but new relevant causal information is later available, suggesting potential adjustments could be made with respect to the original judgment. Study 1 ( N = 206) found that both Chinese and American participants showed revaluative attributions regarding the target cause when a nontarget cause was decreased in its validity during a subsequent phase. That is, the target cause was later judged as more valid when a nontarget cause was decreased in validity (the deflation effect). However, only American participants exhibited a significant decrease in the perceived validity of a target cause when the nontarget cause was increased in its validity (the inflation effect). Study 2 ( N = 189) replicated these findings and also showed that dialectical thinking was a mediator of this cultural difference in revaluative attributions.

The role of attribution of motivation in producing postsuppressional rebound.,2001,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.377,52,Three studies demonstrated that postsuppressional rebound (PSR) may be both reduced and enhanced by manipulating people's attributions about why they experience difficulty during suppression. Telling participants that suppression failures indicate a high motivation to use the suppressed construct produced more PSR than telling them that suppression failures indicate a low motivation to use the construct (Study 1). Telling participants that an external stimulus would make suppression easy produced more PSR than telling them that it would make suppression difficult (Study 2). Telling participants that suppressing a stereotype is difficult and unindicative of prejudice eliminated PSR (Study 3).

Objectives: The data extracted are processed further to compress as a data with less number of features, such a way that the compressed data still has the power of effective discriminators. In this case feature space has less dimensionality then the text itself. Methods/Approach: In this paper, the data collected by counting words and characters in around a thousand paragraphs of each sample book, underwent a principal component analysis performed using neural networks. Once the analysis was complete, the first of the principal components is used to distinguish the books authored by a certain author. Results: The achieved results show that every author leaves a unique signature in written text that can be discovered by analyzing counts of short words per paragraph.

In Study 1, consistent with cognitive models of depression, external attributions for negative events were associated with reductions in self‐actual: self‐ideal discrepancies. Study 2 revealed significantly different effects on self‐discrepancies of three types of causal attributions. Internal attributions led to increased self‐actual: self‐ideal discrepancies as well as increased discrepancies between selfperceptions and the believed views of others about the self (self‐actual: other‐actual discrepancies). External situational attributions led to no changes in either self‐actual: self‐ideal or self‐actual: other‐actual discrepancies. External personal attributions led to no changes in self‐actual: self‐ideal discrepancies but increased self‐actual: other‐actual discrepancies. These findings point to the value of distinguishing between different kinds of external attributions.

Text spinners help spammers in evading plagiarism detectors by automatically restructuring sentences and replacing words or phrases with their synonyms. Prior work on spun content detection relies on the knowledge about the dictionary used by the text spinning software. In this work, we propose an approach to detect spun content and its seed without needing the text spinner's dictionary. Our key idea is that text spinners introduce stylometric artifacts that can be leveraged for detecting spun documents. We implement and evaluate our proposed approach on a corpus of spun documents that are generated using a popular text spinning software.

Helplessness and Self-Blame Attributions in Depression: Investigation of one Possible Resolution of This Paradox among College Students in Taiwan,1996,https://doi.org/10.6251/bep.19960901.10,1,"Depressed persons often feel helpless to change their environment, and at the same time blame themselves for being the cause of misfortune. Paradoxically, they believe they have no effect on events, and in another sense they believe they have powerful effects. The purpose of this study was to examine a resolution of this paradox offered by Janoff-Bulman's model of self-blame attributions for depression which distinguishes between ”behavioral self-blame” and ”characterological self-blame”. In this study, college students in Taiwan were administered three Chinese versions of instruments, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Attributional Style Questionnaire－a measure of helplessness, and the Self-Blame Scale. Of 1443 students who returned surveys, a stratified sample of1000 participants was analyzed.
Six research hypotheses were derived from Janoff-Bulman's model. Correlational evidence supported four of the six. Both general self-blame and helplessness were significantly positively correlated with depression. These findings support both Beck's and Seligman's models of depression, and support the existence of the paradox of belief in which depressed persons feel both helpless and self-blame about the same event.
As predicted by Janoff-Bulman's model, characterological self-blame was significantly correlated with depression and helplessness.

Thus, findings of this study supported Janoff-Bulman's model of self-blame with regard to assumptions about characterological self-blame, but not with regard to assumptions about behavioral self-blame.

Maternal Attributional Style and Infant Attachment,2010,,0,"In Mary Ainsworth's (Ainsworth et al., 1978) seminal examination of maternal factors that shape the development of the caregiver-infant attachment relationship, maternal sensitivity, responsiveness, and appropriately stimulating play were associated with security of attachment. Mothers characterized as clinically depressed have been consistently reported to be low or inconsistent in these characteristics (e.g., Campbell et al., 2004; Martins & Gaffan, 2000; Teti, Gelfand, Messinger, & Isabella, 1995). Evidence suggests that one mechanism for the relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment may be via the mother's attributional style, or how one generally perceives control of positive and negative events in one's life (Peterson et al., 1982). Although individuals diagnosed with clinical depression typically present with a pessimistic attributional style (perceiving little or no control over events in their lives, or perhaps feeling responsible for primarily negative events), it has been suggested that nondepressed individuals may show a similar attributional style as a precursor to depression or evidence of mild (nonclinical) depression (Peterson et al.). The purpose of the present study was to explore the relationship in a low-risk sample between the mother's attributional style and the quality of the mother-infant attachment relationship to determine whether mothers perhaps prone to depressive thoughts and behaviors may be less likely to have secure attachment relationships with their infants. First, an understanding of how maternal depression contributes to the quality of the attachment relationship is important. Maternal depression may influence infant functioning both directly and indirectly.

To test this hypothesis, Chinese Ss (N = 56) in the experiment watched two confederates (Cs) working on an intellectual task. These Cs were either competent or incompetent and subsequently made either self-effacing or self-enhancing attributions for their performance. Ss then rated them on 12 seven-point bipolar scales tapping likability, competence, and anxiety. Results indicated that a self-effacing C was better liked but rated as less competent than a self-enhancing C. Though in the United States competent persons are better liked, such a finding was not replicated in the present study. Consistent with a self-presentational analysis, incompetent performers who made self-enhancing attributions were perceived as more anxious than performers in the other conditions.

Depressive symptoms and anger were hypothesized to relate to discipline via their link with parents' attributions. Path analyses revealed that depressive symptoms predicted parent-centered causal attributions (i.e., stable, global, and dispositional), which, in turn, related to laxness. Depressive symptoms also predicted child-centered responsibility attributions (i.e., controllable, intentional, and negative), which, in turn, related to overreactivity. Anger predicted overreactivity directly. The patterns of relations were similar for fathers and mothers. The importance of addressing parents' psychological difficulties and dysfunctional attributions in interventions for families with disruptive children is discussed.","['Attribution', 'Anger', 'Psychology', 'Dysfunctional family', 'Psychological intervention', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Debbie W.

Recentred local profiles for authorship attribution,2011,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1351324911000180,40,"Abstract Authorship attribution methods aim to determine the author of a document, by using information gathered from a set of documents with known authors. One method of performing this task is to create profiles containing distinctive features known to be used by each author. In this paper, a new method of creating an author or document profile is presented that detects features considered distinctive, compared to normal language usage. This recentreing approach creates more accurate profiles than previous methods, as demonstrated empirically using a known corpus of authorship problems. This method, named recentred local profiles, determines authorship accurately using a simple ‘best matching author’ approach to classification, compared to other methods in the literature. The proposed method is shown to be more stable than related methods as parameter values change. Using a weighted voting scheme, recentred local profiles is shown to outperform other methods in authorship attribution, with an overall accuracy of 69.9% on the ad-hoc authorship attribution competition corpus, representing a significant improvement over related methods.","['Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Voting', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Information retrieval', 'Task (project management)', 'Attribution', 'Matching (statistics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Scheme (mathematics)', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Statistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Management', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Programming language']","['Robert Layton', 'Paul Watters', 'Richard Dazeley']",25,False,Natural Language Engineering,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
An attributional analysis of corporate reporting in crisis situations,2014,https://doi.org/10.1108/jcom-09-2012-0074,6,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to use an attributional approach to examine press coverage in Germany dealing with Toyota’s 2010 global product recall due to purportedly defective brakes. The research focuses on the attributions of cause and responsibility and, thereby, the practices of media-brokered selection and interpretation of events. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology used is a quantitative content analysis of selected German print media. Corporate reporting is analysed with the help of attribution theory approaches from the field of psychology, which, when applied to public relations themes, thereby enables the identification of latent and manifest risk factors that emerge from the perceived responsibility of the media. Findings – Causal attributions are an essential aspect of coverage in acute crisis situations. The key findings show a dominance of internal attributions of responsibility in which the media interprets the crisis as self inflicted and ascribes a high level of fault on the company. Exonerating attributions according to a self-serving bias find little resonance in the coverage. The responsibility attributed to Toyota by the media coverage to a sustained damage to the company’s reputation. Originality/value – The study demonstrates that attribution theory can be productively applied to questions of communication management. This approach enables an analysis of attribution discourse as well as the potential long-term effects on the company’s reputation. Thus, the original value of this study lies in the psychological foundation of organisational risk and opportunity.","['Attribution', 'Reputation', 'Corporate social responsibility', 'Dominance (genetics)', 'Originality', 'Value (mathematics)', 'Content analysis', 'German', 'Public relations', 'Crisis communication', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Business', 'Sociology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Computer science', 'Social science', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Machine learning', 'Creativity', 'Gene']",['Falk Tennert'],22,False,Journal of Communication Management,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Correlation Of Terms 'Fiction’ – ‘Nonfiction' In Biographical Works By Peter Ackroyd,2018,https://doi.org/10.15405/epsbs.2018.04.02.28,0,"On the example of books by P. Ackroyd and the developed in Russia literary history and criticism studies of his works, this article discusses the existing terms in the sphere of fictional and nonfictional texts of biographies and history based literature, such as ‘historical metafiction’, ‘docufiction’, ‘mockumentary’, ‘fake fiction’, ‘false narrative’, etc., in comparison to the existing Russian terminology of text attribution; as well as in contrast to the genre and style of academic biography. The study of methodology for academic biographical writings in combination with the cognitive attitude in the form of gradual estimation gives grounds to an outline gradual scale, which considers variations of biographical genre from nonfictional informative texts to fictional creative writings. The parameters for grading such texts on the cognitive scale are summarized in the form of a chart, which includes the author and reader perceptive criteria for the suggested distribution of terms. The examples of some P. Ackroyd’s books show that a particular author can create texts of different grades on the ‘fiction – nonfiction’ scale, even if it was not the writer’s intention to mark his texts evidently as ‘true’ or ‘false’.

Changes in Free Symptom Attributions in Hypochondriasis after Cognitive Therapy and Exposure Therapy,2016,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1352465816000163,5,"Background: Cognitive-behavioural therapy can change dysfunctional symptom attributions in patients with hypochondriasis. Past research has used forced-choice answer formats, such as questionnaires, to assess these misattributions; however, with this approach, idiosyncratic attributions cannot be assessed. Free associations are an important complement to existing approaches that assess symptom attributions. Aims: With this study, we contribute to the current literature by using an open-response instrument to investigate changes in freely associated attributions after exposure therapy (ET) and cognitive therapy (CT) compared with a wait list (WL). Method: The current study is a re-examination of a formerly published randomized controlled trial (Weck, Neng, Richtberg, Jakob and Stangier, 2015) that investigated the effectiveness of CT and ET. Seventy-three patients with hypochondriasis were randomly assigned to CT, ET or a WL, and completed a 12-week treatment (or waiting period). Before and after the treatment or waiting period, patients completed an Attribution task in which they had to spontaneously attribute nine common bodily sensations to possible causes in an open-response format. Results: Compared with the WL, both CT and ET reduced the frequency of somatic attributions regarding severe diseases (CT: Hedges's g = 1.12; ET: Hedges's g = 1.03) and increased the frequency of normalizing attributions (CT: Hedges's g = 1.17; ET: Hedges's g = 1.24). Only CT changed the attributions regarding moderate diseases (Hedges's g = 0.69). Changes in somatic attributions regarding mild diseases and psychological attributions were not observed. Conclusions: Both CT and ET are effective for treating freely associated misattributions in patients with hypochondriasis.

"Digital Borders, Location Recognition, and Experience Attribution Within a Digital Geography",2019,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3340276,0,"During an online session, a user may visit a number of websites, often following hyperlinks from one website to the next or using a search results page to find and visit pages of interest. In doing so, the user can lose track of which sites were visited and which were helpful in meeting the intended objective. Consequently, sites that may have provided value to the user may not receive expected positive effects such as loyalty and intention to return. It is thus crucial to understand if and how an individual website is perceived by users within the context of multi-website online sessions—particularly in predicting desired website interaction outcomes, such as loyalty, trust, brand image, and revisit intentions. To address this problem, we conceptualize the Web as a geography traversed by users who cross digital borders as they move from one website location to another. We introduce the concept of border strength, or the degree to which digital media artifacts mark a transition to a website, and propose a positive effect of border strength on users’ recognition of their locations. We then consider users’ attribution of credit for assistance in successfully completing an online task to those websites and their owners that actually supported the task. We explain that this attribution is a function of border strength and location recognition. We test these hypotheses using experimental data, which show that, indeed, some websites go unrecognized. Importantly, we show that stronger borders increase users’ recognition of having visited a website and users’ credit attribution for their experience to the site.","['Attribution', 'Geography', 'Computer science', 'Data science', 'Cartography', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Brian Kimball Dunn', 'Dennis F.

Causal attributions for somatic sensations in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and their partners,2001,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291799003001,62,"Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) often make somatic attributions for their illness which has been associated with poor outcome. A tendency to make somatic attributions in general may be a vulnerability factor for the development of CFS.This cross-sectional study based on self-report questionnaire data aimed to investigate the type of attributions for symptoms made by patients with CFS and to compare this to attributions made by their partners. It was hypothesized that patients with CFS would make more somatic attributions for their own symptoms than control subjects and that partners of patients with CFS would make more somatic attributions for their ill relative's symptoms but would be similar to controls regarding their own symptoms. Fifty patients with CFS were compared to 50 controls from a fracture clinic in the same hospital and 46 relatives living with the patients with CFS. A modified Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire was used to assess causal attributions.CFS patients were more likely to make somatic attributions for their symptoms. The relatives of patients with CFS made significantly more somatic attributions for symptoms in their ill relative. However, they were like the fracture clinic controls in terms of making predominantly normalizing attributions for their own symptoms.The data support modification of existing cognitive behavioural treatments for CFS to investigate whether addressing partners' attributions for patients' symptoms improves recovery in the patient. Furthermore, a tendency to make somatic attributions for symptoms may be a vulnerability factor for the development of CFS.","['Attribution', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Cognition', 'Medicine', 'Chronic fatigue', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Communication', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics']","['John Butler', 'Trudie Chalder', 'Simon Wessely']",21,False,Psychological Medicine,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Who wrote the first <i>Constitutions</i> of Freemasonry?,2024,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqae023,0,"Abstract This article addresses the problematic authorship of The Constitutions of the Free-Masons (1723). Traditionally associated with James Anderson, using stylometry, we examine whether and, if so, where John T. Desaguliers, the prime mover of early English institutionalized Freemasonry, contributed to this publication. Our corpus includes writings by Anderson, Desaguliers, and two contemporary Freemasons used as distractors. The transcribed works contain texts from different genres and of varying lengths. In our methodology, we employ a wide range of robust, multivariate, unsupervised, and cross-validated supervised tests, verified through significance testing, which can hopefully contribute to the establishment of standards for historical authorship attribution. Our results suggest, in line with historical evidence, that the legendary history of the Constitutions was most likely primarily authored by Anderson. However, several of the Charges including the first one ‘Concerning God and religion’, one of the most disputed texts in the history of Freemasonry, are closer to the style of Desaguliers. The General Regulations concerning the organization of the lodges, hitherto attributed to George Payne, played a fundamental role in spreading Freemasonry worldwide. Our analyses show that the stylistic affinity of fifteen of the thirty-nine regulations has a pronounced closeness to Anderson’s style, five align more closely with Desaguliers’ style. The authorship of the rest remains inconclusive partly due to the insufficient length of texts by Payne. These novel findings are also supported by a close reading of the Constitutions and other contemporary primary sources.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Reading (process)', 'Stylometry', 'Closeness', 'History', 'Prime minister', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Linguistics', 'Law', 'Art', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Mathematics']","['Robert H.

The mediational effects of attributions and information processing in minority social influence,1996,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8309.1996.tb01082.x,29,"Minority influence research has focused on behavioural factors that lead to successful social influence, such as acting in a consistent manner, but has tended to ignore the psychological processes that may mediate successful influence. Moscovici (1976) posited that such psychological mediators include attributions concerning the causes for the minority's behaviour and a validation process in which subjects carefully consider the issues raised by the minority position. The current article examines the links between social cognition theories of stereotyping and attitude/impression formation and minority influence by delineating the role of both attributions and systematic message appraisal in minority influence. Successful minority influence was predicted to be dependent on the types of attributions formed towards the minority because such attributions influence the manner in which we attend to and think about a minority position. The data reveal that subjects with positive attributions were more influenced by the minority message than subjects with negative attributions. More importantly, this difference in persuasiveness was shown to be mediated by different cognitive processing strategies—subjects with positive attributions were more likely to systematically process the minority message. In addition to exploring the cognitive underpinnings of successful minority influence, the impact of social pressure and power struggles between social groups is considered in evaluating the applied value of such process‐oriented research. Finally, it is suggested that while consistent behaviour is one way in which the minority can draw attention to its position and increase the likelihood of influence, recent models and stereotyping and impression formation suggest another approach. Instead of the minority accepting the burden for instigating a validation process in members of the majority, such attention and validation can be instilled in those perceiving the minority through ado","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Cognition', 'Impression formation', 'Social cognition', 'Attribution bias', 'Impression management', 'Social perception', 'Developmental psychology', 'Perception', 'Neuroscience']",['Gordon B.

Significant differences were found between the middle-class Portuguese and Lebanese students on the individualistic and fatalistic dimensions. Middle-class Lebanese students were significantly more fatalistic than their Portuguese counterparts. Furthermore, middle-class Lebanese students documented greater individualistic interpretations of poverty than did Portuguese. MANCOVA test, which used class crossed with nationality on the poverty dimensions, and gender as a covariate did not yield significant differences between means. Wilks' Lambda regression coefficient showed a significant interaction between-class and nationality on the fatalistic dimension.

Influence of Childhood Trauma on Former Prisoners’ Attributional Style and Recidivism in Three Years,2021,https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.22128,0,"This study aimed to verify the mediating effects of attribution style, both external and internal, in the relationship between childhood trauma and former prisoners’ recidivism. In 2017, recidivism data on 235 former prisoners who had received Korea Rehabilitation Agency (KRA)’s housing support service in 2014, and had responded to the childhood traumatic questionnaire and surveys on external and internal attributions, were retrieved from the KRA. The analysis revealed that greater childhood trauma was correlated both with higher external and lower internal attribution. Although the relationship between high childhood trauma and recidivism was significant, no significant relationship appeared between internal/external attribution and recidivism. Further, the analysis did not confirm the mediating effect of attribution on the relationship between childhood trauma and recidivism. This indicates that traumatic experiences during childhood increase former prisoners’ external attribution, lower internal attribution, and lead to a higher probability of recidivism. These results demonstrate that interventions on childhood trauma may be effective in lowering recidivism because childhood trauma plays a key role in the former prisoners’ reoffending and attributions that may influence the interpretation of their criminal behavior.","['Recidivism', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychological intervention', 'Rehabilitation', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Hayoung Jung', 'Donghun Lee']",0,True,Collabra Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Who wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i>?,2020,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqaa031,20,"Abstract Emily Brontë published Wuthering Heights in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell. It was not until the later second edition, published after Emily’s death, that she was credited as the novel’s author. Those Victorian attitudes towards women which compelled Brontë to publish as Bell have not been wholly eradicated, with her legitimacy as the sole author being called into question by male commentators at several junctures since. Their claim is that Emily’s brother Branwell is the real author of Wuthering Heights. Using stylometry, a computer-assisted technique which measures the likely author of a text, this brief experiment demonstrates that it is highly unlikely that Branwell Brontë contributed to the writing of Wuthering Heights, and that Emily, as generally considered, is the novel’s sole author. Furthermore, considering a number of limitations with the corpus being tested, this study provides a good and necessary example of stylometry in practice, and how such an experiment should be conducted in less-than-ideal circumstances.","['Stylometry', 'Pseudonym', 'Ideal (ethics)', 'Brother', 'Literature', 'Legitimacy', 'History', 'Law', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Political science', 'Linguistics', 'Politics']","['Rachel McCarthy', 'James O’Sullivan']",23,False,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Achievement Attributions of Sixth Grade Children and Their Parents,1999,https://doi.org/10.1080/0144341990190402,58,"Abstract The present study examines the achievement attributions of Greek Cypriot students and their parents. Its aim was to investigate the role of parental and child achievement attributions as parameters of the child's actual school achievement and to examine the existing differences between attributions made by children and their parents. A total of 477 Sixth Grade Greek Cypriot students and their parents participated in the study. A structural equation model was constructed and its ability to fit the data was tested. It was found that child attributions of achievement to effort, ability and other internal factors are positively related to actual achievement, while attributions to luck and external factors are negatively related to achievement. This is in line with earlier findings. Parental and child attributions are not strongly and reliably related. Thus, claims that children develop their own attributions on the basis of their parents’ attributions were not supported. Gender differences were found, with females attributing their achievement to effort more than males did. Finally, underachievers tended to attribute their school performance to external factors (luck, role of others such as parents and teachers), while highly achieving students tended to attribute their performance to their own effort and other internal factors.","['Attribution', 'Luck', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Academic achievement', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Theology']",['Στέλιος Ν.

The effect of help-seeking and enhancement tendencies on causal attributions for helping,2002,,0,"This thesis investigates help-seeking and effects of help-seeking on causal attributions for helping (i.e., what people believe caused help or lack of help). Additionally, it examines self-serving and other-serving attributions (i.e., to augment a person's positive sides and diminish the negative ones). Help-seeking was investigated in questionnaires, describing situations where spouses collaborate in doing household chores. A first study showed that women and men report using direct styles (i.e., explicitly verbalising the requests) more often than indirect ones. A second study showed that spouses inaccurately believe that wives in general would report more indirect and less direct styles than husbands in general. Causal attributions for helping were investigated in four studies with different methods, settings, and types of relationships (questionnaires, laboratory experiment; spouses doing chores, students and strangers doing computerized exercises). Consistent support was obtained for a predicted interaction between helping and the clarity of the request for help in determining the attributions. It is suggested that this finding is an effect of people comparing the behavior of one person with their beliefs about how other persons behave (i.e., consensus). Additionally, the findings did not support the claims that people make self-serving attributions and that the latter would be more pronounced among men than women. However, the attributions were other-serving. The thesis gives a novel understanding of everyday life by combining the issues of help-seeking and causal attributions. It also offers a discussion of the previous literature and of theoretical and applied implications of the findings.","['Attribution', 'CLARITY', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Helping behavior', 'Help-seeking', 'Mental health', 'Psychotherapist', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry']",['Ingrid Olsson'],0,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

In the present research, we adapted the paradigm used in studies of the attribution of responsibility for an accident to examine a specific audience-inhibition process that may contribute to the social inhibition of helping. Evidence from two experiments showed that an individual who adopted the perspective of a helper following an accident expected to be held increasingly responsible by arriving onlookers for the victim's plight as the number of extant bystanders increased. Results also indicated that there was an objective basis for this expectation: Subjects who adopted the perspective of a newly arriving onlooker increasingly attributed responsibility for doing harm to the individual helping the victim in the accident as the number of bystanders described as already at the scene increased.

Across three studies examining different contexts, more anti-egalitarian White participants and more highly identified White participants rated a half-White, half-minority target as being shaped more by his minority (vs. White) background when he was disreputable (vs. reputable)—patterns broadly consistent with prior theorizing on the motivations to maintain social stratification and protect ingroup standing, respectively. In direct contrast, however, egalitarian White participants and White participants low on ethnic identification credited a target’s outgroup minority background when he was reputable (vs. disreputable), consistent with a desire to promote social equality and forgoing the opportunity to “bask in reflected glory” on behalf of the ingroup.

Results showed that female behavior predicted positive and negative attributions as well as behavioral intentions. Individual differences were less critical to the prediction of attributions or intentions.

Victim attributions and post-rape trauma.,1990,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.298,210,"This study assessed (a) the kinds of attributions victims make, (b) whether behavioral and characterological self-blame are associated with other variables as hypothesized (e.g., perception of future avoidability of being raped), and (c) whether behavioral self-blame is associated with better post-rape adjustment (Janoff-Bulman, 1979). Attributions and adjustment were assessed in a sample of adult female rape victims seen at a hospital-based rape crisis program. Many victims blamed themselves but tended to place more blame on external factors. The pattern of relations between behavioral and characterological self-blame and other attributional measures did not support the hypothesized distinctions between them. Both kinds of self-blame were significantly associated with increased post-rape depression (all ps less than .05). Attributions strongly predicted adjustment, accounting for up to 67% of the variance in 3-day post-rape depression.

Attribution Markers and Data Mining in Art Authentication,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27010070,9,"Today's global art market is a billion-dollar business, attracting not only investors but also forgers. The high number of forged works requires reliable authentication procedures to mitigate the risk of investments. However, with the developments in the methodology, continuous time pressure and the threat of litigation, authenticating artwork is becoming increasingly complex. In this paper, we examined whether the decision process involved in the authenticity examination may be supported by machine learning algorithms. The idea is motivated by existing clinical decision support systems. We used a set of 55 artworks (including 12 forged ones) with determined attribution markers to train a decision tree model. From our preliminary results, it follows that it is a very promising technique able to support art experts. Decision trees are able to summarize the existing knowledge about all investigations and may also be used as a classifier for new paintings with known markers. However, larger datasets with artworks of known provenance are needed to build robust classification models. The method can also utilize the most important markers and, consequently, reduce the costs of investigations.","['Decision tree', 'Computer science', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Process (computing)', 'Data science', 'Machine learning', 'Decision support system', 'Attribution', 'Authentication (law)', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Operating system']","['Barbara Łydżba‐Kopczyńska', 'Janusz Szwabiński']",19,True,Molecules,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Using Gale's nineteenth-century British newspaper collections, this paper suggests how best to read the evidence of duplicated content obtained through text mining and explores the extent to which this level of analysis can distinguish between different editorial or production styles. Delving into a close reading of the Caledonian Mercury between 1820 and 1840, this study then tests hypotheses about word count and publication frequency developed through distant reading and determines its most common editorial structures. The study concludes with an exploration of how to extrapolate conclusions from close readings to support a more nuanced understanding of the results of large-scale textual analyses. Overall, it argues that iterative testing through both big data and close reading methodologies, a so-called middle-scale analysis, provides a better method for understanding the ambiguous and shifting structures of nineteenth-century newspapers as well as the points of connection between them.","['Newspaper', 'Reading (process)', 'Journalism', 'History', 'Big data', 'Close reading', 'Computer science', 'Media studies', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Sociology', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Data mining']",['M.

NO-DOUBT: Attack Attribution Based On Threat Intelligence Reports,2019,https://doi.org/10.1109/isi.2019.8823152,19,"The task of attack attribution, i.e., identifying the entity responsible for an attack, is complicated and usually requires the involvement of an experienced security expert. Prior attempts to automate attack attribution apply various machine learning techniques on features extracted from the malware's code and behavior in order to identify other similar malware whose authors are known. However, the same malware can be reused by multiple actors, and the actor who performed an attack using a malware might differ from the malware's author. Moreover, information collected during an incident may contain many clues about the identity of the attacker in addition to the malware used. In this paper, we propose a method of attack attribution based on textual analysis of threat intelligence reports, using state of the art algorithms and models from the fields of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). We have developed a new text representation algorithm which captures the context of the words and requires minimal feature engineering. Our approach relies on vector space representation of incident reports derived from a small collection of labeled reports and a large corpus of general security literature. Both datasets have been made available to the research community. Experimental results show that the proposed representation can attribute attacks more accurately than the baselines' representations. In addition, we show how the proposed approach can be used to identify novel previously unseen threat actors and identify similarities between known threat actors.","['Computer science', 'Malware', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Representation (politics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Attribution', 'Task (project management)', 'Computer security', 'Machine learning', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Management', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Lior Perry', 'Bracha Shapira', 'Rami Puzis']",19,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Secondary School Students’ Causal Attribution of Success And Failure in Mathematics,2018,,0,"Just reacting to the events that happen to him/her is not enough to please the human being. Beyond that, what makes him/her happy is to understand why the events come to the scene and why other people behave differently in the face of the same events. The attribution theory is concerned with why one investigates the causes of one's own and others' behaviour, the diversity of the attributed causes, and the effects of these attributions on one's feelings, motivations and future behaviours. Literature in the field of attribution theory suggests a relationship between the way students explain the causes of their academic performance and academic achievement. The aim of this research was to reveal 8th grade students’ causal attributions for success and failure in mathematics. The research group was comprised of 15 eighth grade students. A semi-structured interview form consisting of 8 open-ended questions was used to gather data. Each interviews were tape-recorded and lasted about 10-15 minutes. All registered data were transcribed, and analysed by using the content analysis method. The results of the study revealed that the participated students explained being successful in mathematics with hard work, well listening to the lesson, and having mathematical ability. Moreover, there were the students who attributed their failures to reasons such as not accepting teacher’s teaching style, considering mathematics as difficult, and having prejudgment to mathematics. The fact that there are many formulas in mathematics, and that it is hard to memorize them was a failure cause in mathematics for some students.","['Attribution', 'Feeling', 'Memorization', 'Mathematics education', 'Active listening', 'Psychology', 'Diversity (politics)', 'Face (sociological concept)', 'Social psychology', 'Social science', 'Communication', 'Sociology', 'Anthropology']",['Savaş Baştürk'],0,False,"ICPESS (International Congress on Politic, Economic and Social  Studies)",[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

We introduce a forensic approach to help solve the problem of traceability when content is stolen en masse from one site and hosted on another. Content is first minified and then watermarked repeatedly with unique identifiers using a sparse encoding tailored to the user's available steganographic bandwidth. When scraped content is discovered, the encoded identifiers can be traced back to specific events in server logs, as a powerful aid in identifying perpetrators and to help combat this practice.","['Computer science', 'Identifier', 'World Wide Web', 'Traceability', 'Scripting language', 'Computer security', 'Digital forensics', 'The Internet', 'Internet privacy', 'Computer network', 'Software engineering', 'Operating system']",['Aaron Koehl'],12,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Sino-Tibetan Style of Buddhist Sculpture: Articulation of the Attribution Problem,2022,https://doi.org/10.15826/izv2.2022.24.2.039,0,"This article is devoted to the concept of “style” and the possibility of its application in the attribution of works of Buddhist metal sculpture. This aspect, which, as a rule, is peripheral for classical Oriental studies, Buddhology, and history, where it is interpreted quite freely, is one of the key ones for art history and museum attribution activities. The author notes the terminological and factual diversity of the designation of the “Sino-Tibetan style” in the circle of researchers of the art of Buddhism. The author poses the question of what exactly the concept of “Sino-Tibetan style” means and whether it is an indication of the body of technical and plastic features of sculptures, or just a designation of the geography of the origin of Buddhist sculptures of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries made in the western provinces of China. The author refers to three sculptures which are the most controversial ones from the point of view of attribution (Maitreya Buddha from the private collection of A. V. Glazyrin (Ekaterinburg), Shakyamuni Buddha, and Begtse from the collection of the Sverdlovsk Regional Museum of Local Lore), which have several similar stylistic features, and which could presumably be attributed to the “Sino-Tibetan style” of the eighteenth century. Also, the article presents the results of the study of the metal composition of these sculptures using an X-ray fluorescence analyser (spectrometer). Based on the data obtained on the content of substances in the alloy and considering the general artistic and stylistic features of metal images, the author makes a conclusion as to when the attribution designation “Tibeto-Chinese style” is the most accurate one and when it can be applied to Buddhist gilded sculptures created on the territory of China (Manchu Qin dynasty) between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.","['Sculpture', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Buddhism', 'Gautama Buddha', 'Attribution', 'Art', 'China', 'History', 'Literature', 'Aesthetics', 'Visual arts', 'Art history', 'Archaeology', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']",['Victoria Demenova'],3,True,Izvestia of the Ural federal university Series 2 Humanities and Arts,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

P03-81 - Attribution style and reaction to frustration in persistent delusional psychosis,2010,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0924-9338(10)71191-3,0,"Objectives Attribution style and reaction to frustration play an important part in both depression and paranoia. The objective was to study the attribution style and frustration reaction between persistent delusional psychosis with depression and persistent without depression. Materials and method Fourty patients diagnosed with ICD 10 persistent delusional disorder with a period of evolution of 8 years, was grouped into 2 subgroups: a) with depression and b) without depression. All are part of the Cases Registrer of Timisoara Psychiatric Clinic (CRPTC) which monitors the functional psychoses from 1985. For each patient was applied in period of remission BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), ASQ (Attributional Style Questionnaire) and Rosenzweig frustration test. Results The persistent delusional psychosis without depressive features present a more internal and less stable attributions of the negative events. For the positive events, the stability and globality is higher for those with depression. Concerning the response to frustrating situations, persistent delusional psychosis with depression give answers prevailling extrapunitiveness, whereas those without depression give prevailling need-persistence answers. There are significant similarities between the two groups concerning the type of persisting necessity. Conclusions Among the persistent delusional psychosis, those with depressive features demonstrate an agresivity directed more towards exterior in the frustrating situations and associate less the negative events with their own personality than the pure persistent delusional.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Paranoia', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychosis', 'Delusion', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['M Lăzărescu', 'I.

Understanding Career College Reentry Students: A Cross-Cultural Investigation of Locus of Control and Attributional Retraining.,1997,,1,"The question of whether internal versus external locus of control for generalized expectancies of reinforcement is an important variable in working with college reentry students was examined in a descriptive study. Subjects were 24 women (9 Caucasians, 7 African Americans, and 8 Hispanic Americans aged 19 to 24 years) enrolled in a proprietary business career junior college in a major metropolitan area of the southern United States. The women completed the Rotter Internal External Locus of Control Scale (IE Scale) and a student survey containing questions about respondents' ethnic background, grade-point average (GPA), and 1994 income. Of the three groups, the Hispanic women had the lowest IE scores (a fact attributed to their cultural heritage, Latina achievement styles, and the strength of their familial commitments). Among the African American students, there was an aggregate of single mothers with high GPAs, extremely low income levels, and very external IE scores. Attributional retraining programs were concluded to be a viable remedial intervention for assisting at-risk college students. (The reference list and bibliography contain 63 references.

Parents, siblings, and spouses of the mentally ill patients were interviewed in the United States and Japan with regard to how they perceived the cause of the illness of their loved ones. They struggle to make sense out of the tragedy by searching for the plausible reason for the illness. The perceived causes were mainly divided into two groups: (a) factors relating to the early family socialization and (b) genetic factors. Other possible causes included a traumatic event in later life, karmic influence based on the Buddhist perspective, and cult religion. However, few were convinced about their own theories as most wavered between different causal explanations and continued to question what caused it. The parents were often tormented by self-blame, and some family members still doubted the diagnosis and hoped the patient's problem was caused by drug addiction. Regardless of the accuracy of their causal attribution, their mental struggle is an important part of the cognitive adjustment process toward better acceptance of the mental illness in the family.","['Attribution', 'Mental illness', 'Blame', 'Psychology', 'Tragedy (event)', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Interpretation (philosophy)', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Mental health', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']",['Yuko Kawanishi'],13,False,International Journal of Mental Health,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Emotional expression recognition and attribution bias among sexual and violent offenders: a signal detection analysis,2015,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00595,37,"Research with violent offenders has consistently shown impaired recognition of other's facial expressions of emotion. However, the extent to which similar problems can be observed among sexual offenders remains unknown. Using a computerized task, we presented sexual and violent offenders, and non-offenders, with male and female expressions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise, morphed with neutral expressions at varying levels of intensity (10, 55, and 90% expressive). Based on signal detection theory, we used hit rates and false alarms to calculate the sensitivity index d-prime (d') and criterion (c) for each emotional expression. Overall, sexual offenders showed reduced sensitivity to emotional expressions across intensity, sex, and type of expression, compared with non-offenders, while both sexual and violent offenders showed particular reduced sensitivity to fearful expressions. We also observed specific effects for high (90%) intensity female faces, with sexual offenders showing reduced sensitivity to anger compared with non-offenders and violent offenders, and reduced sensitivity to disgust compared with non-offenders. Furthermore, both sexual and violent offenders showed impaired sensitivity to high intensity female fearful expressions compared with non-offenders. Violent offenders also showed a higher criterion for classifying moderate and high intensity male expressions as fearful, indicative of a more conservative response style, compared with angry, happy, or sad. These results suggest that both types of offender show problems in emotion recognition, and may have implications for understanding the inhibition of violent and sexually violent behaviors.","['Psychology', 'Disgust', 'Anger', 'Sadness', 'Facial expression', 'Emotional expression', 'Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Communication']","['Steven M.

Blaming the Victim: The Effects of Extraversion and Information Disclosure on Guilt Attributions in Cyberbullying,2013,https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2012.0328,69,"Cyberbullying victims' success in coping with bullying largely depends on schoolmates and other bystanders' social support. However, factors influencing the degree of social support have as yet not been investigated. In this article, the concept of victim blaming is applied to cyberbullying incidents. It is assumed that a cyberbullying victim receives less social support when the victim's behavior is perceived as very overt. It is further assumed that this effect's underlying process is the partial attribution of responsibility for the incident to the victim and not to the bully. The hypotheses are tested with a 2×2 online experiment. In this experiment, varying online self-presentations of a fictitious female cyberbullying victim were presented to 586 Germans aged 16-22. The victim's public Facebook profile was manipulated in terms of the victim's extraversion and the amount of personal information disclosed. The results support the hypotheses. Participants attributed more responsibility for the bullying incident to the victim when the victim was presented as extraverted and very open in revealing personal information. This diminished social support for the victim. The effect was partially mediated by the victim's perceived attractiveness. The study implies that concepts from victimization research can enhance our understanding of cyberbullying incidents. Among other factors, the victim's specific personal characteristics deserve more consideration--not only with regard to the incident itself but also regarding subsequent social dynamics and coping mechanisms.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Extraversion and introversion', 'Attractiveness', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Personality', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychoanalysis']","['Mathias Weber', 'Marc Ziegele', 'Anna Schnauber']",45,False,Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Learning Based Fingerprinting to Improve Deepfake Attribution,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3551626.3564981,1,"Artificial Fingerprinting (AF or the so-called digital watermarking) is a technique that can be used to conduct Deepfake attribution by ensuring media authenticity. However, AF does not prioritize its robustness to certain kinds of distortions, making the embedded watermarks vulnerable to some standard image processing operations. Insufficient robustness reduces the practicality of digital watermarking techniques. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced distortion agnostic artificial fingerprinting (EDA-AF) framework which introduces a novel noise layer consisting of an attack booster followed by a convolutional network-based attacker. The attacker simulates various distortions by exploiting adversarial learning with AF for distortion agnostic robustness. Meanwhile, due to the modeling limitation of the convolutional network, we also employ the attack booster to apply a set of differentiable image distortions which cannot be well simulated by the attacker. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the quality of the extracted fingerprints. EDA-AF can improve the bitwise accuracy by up to 36%, which takes another step forward on the road of Deepfake attribution.","['Computer science', 'Robustness (evolution)', 'Digital watermarking', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Data mining', 'Adversarial system', 'Threat model', 'Computer engineering', 'Adversary', 'Robustness testing', 'Machine learning', 'Computer security', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene', 'Fuzzy logic']","['Chieh-Yin Liao', 'Chen-Hsiu Huang', 'Jun-Cheng Chen', 'Ja‐Ling Wu']",23,True,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

A Major Attribution to the Young Raphael,1991,https://doi.org/10.2307/1483369,0,"Before its recent restoration, the Portrait of a Youth was published in 1987 as a work by Bugiardini dating from about 1525-30. As this article makes clear, such a dating is unacceptable. The costume is precisely like that in Raphael's Portrait of Angelo Doni, which dates from 1504-08. There, too, Doni's hair is shoulder-length, not a fashionable style for young men by 1525.

The attribution to Bugiardini also appears to be mistaken. The stylistic similarities with Raphael's portrait La Donna Gravida suggest that the Youth is in fact a Raphael of c. 1507-08. Raphael repeated the device of the straight lines produced by folds in the background wall-covering when he painted Pope Julius II in 1511-12.

A seal removed from the back of the Youth proves that in the eighteenth century the picture was in the collection of the Earls of Chesterfield.","['Attribution', 'Art', 'Art history', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']",['Cecil Gould'],0,False,Artibus et Historiae,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Thirty-one routes were investigated, related to ingestion of food, direct contact with animals and water. Preliminary results suggest that raw food consumption and direct contact are significant transmission routes, but huge data gaps exist and no solid conclusions can be drawn.

Compared with a well-constructed N-gram baseline method with Kneser-Ney smoothing, the proposed method achieves nearly 2.5% reduction in perplexity and increases author classification accuracy by 3.43% on average, given as few as 5 test sentences.

Collegial conflict: experiencing attribution theory through simulation,2008,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03072.x,8,"Context and setting Collegial conflict within health care environments takes its toll on patient safety, team functioning and the practitioner’s professional relationships. The perceptions and attributions that we assign to the behaviour of others often lead to unaddressed and unresolved conflict. Attribution theory suggests that individuals differ in their causal explanations and perceptions of behaviour and events, which may lead to collegial conflict. The application of an experiential learning module brings attribution theory to life using live simulation and reflective exercises. Why the idea was necessary Co-worker interactions are among the most essential and prevailing representations of organisational relationships across professions. Research has shown that patient outcomes are adversely affected by team conflict. As professionals, we are statistically more proactive and effective in approaching and resolving conflict with patients, clients and students than we are with our peers. What was done A needs assessment survey was originally conducted for mediators in the field of restorative justice regarding professional collegial tensions in the workplace. An interactive workshop was subsequently designed and developed using the survey results as a reference. The goal was to provide a visceral learning opportunity for practitioners with diverse reactions to conflict. Preliminary feedback from participating mediators pointed strongly to the potential educational value of this experiential methodology for health care and other professional settings. The workshop features a didactic component, live simulation and reflective problem-solving exercises, providing participants with a theoretical framework for developing a deeper understanding of attribution theory and its impact on collegial disputes. The dynamic conflict simulation provides participants with a facilitated opportunity to identify, practise and apply specific communication skills and strategies as the","['Attribution', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Experiential learning', 'Psychology', 'Perception', 'Health care', 'Social psychology', 'Applied psychology', 'Pedagogy', 'Political science', 'Paleontology', 'Law', 'Biology', 'Neuroscience']","['Kerry Knickle', 'Nancy McNaughton']",0,True,Medical Education,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Crossing Linguistic Barriers: Authorship Attribution in Sinhala Texts,2024,https://doi.org/10.1145/3655620,0,"Authorship attribution involves determining the original author of an anonymous text from a pool of potential authors. The author attribution task has applications in several domains, such as plagiarism detection, digital text forensics, and information retrieval. While these applications extend beyond any single language, existing research has predominantly centered on English, posing challenges for application in languages such as Sinhala due to linguistic disparities and a lack of language processing tools. We present the first comprehensive study on cross-topic authorship attribution for Sinhala texts and propose a solution that can effectively perform the authorship attribution task even if the topics within the test and training samples differ. Our solution consists of three main parts: (i) extraction of topic-independent stylometric features, (ii) generation of a small candidate author set with the help of similarity search, and (iii) identification of the true author. Several experimental studies were carried out to demonstrate that the proposed solution can effectively handle real-world scenarios involving a large number of candidate authors and a limited number of text samples for each candidate author.","['Authorship attribution', 'Linguistics', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Natural language processing', 'History', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology']","['Raheem Sarwar', 'Maneesha Perera', 'Pin Shen Teh', 'Raheel Nawaz', 'Muhammad Umair Hassan']",59,True,ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

To Grasp the Reasons behind Employee's Behavior:The Development of the Work Attributional Style Questionnaire in Chinese Background,2012,,0,"Attribution theory has been the important topic in the psychology field.With the development of attribution theory,researchers began to expand on the study of attribution theory to research on organization and management field.But the researchers didn't pay enough attention to the field of occupational attribution style.There is no a questionnaire of occupational attributional style.At the same time,exciting work attributional style questionnaires developed in western context,contain some drawbacks,such as low reliability,unstable constructs and so on.Based on this,the present study tries to develop Chinese Work Attributional Style Questionnaire(CWASQ) and examine its reliability and validity. The present study developed the Occupation Attributional Style Questionnaire in context.Through interviews,open questionnaires and the relevant literatures,the researcher formed the first draft of the questionnaire.Through exploratory factor analysis,the first one was revised in some aspects.The results of the formal questionnaire's exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were satisfactory,while the reliability and validity were good.The final questionnaire includes two sub-questionnaires: positive scenarios and negative scenarios;each type of scenarios is composed by five specific events;each event encompasses three questions corresponding to three dimensions: internality,stability and globality.To sum up,the questionnaire consists of a total of 30 questions. The contributions of the study include two main points: for one thing,Chinese Work Attributional Style Questionnaire(CWASQ) is the first work attributional style questionnaire developed in context;for another,CWASQ has several improvements compare to the western work attributional style questionnaires,not only in reliability and validity,but also in the questionnaire form.Particularly,these enhancements that are developed according to faults of existing work attributional style questionnaires are dwe","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Exploratory factor analysis', 'Confirmatory factor analysis', 'Questionnaire', 'Applied psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social psychology', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Computer science', 'Paleontology', 'Social science', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Machine learning', 'Sociology', 'Biology']",['Zhou Wen-xia'],0,False,Economic management journal,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The role of attributional judgments when adopted computing technology fails: a comparison of Microsoft Windows PC user perceptions of Windows and Macs,2012,https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929x.2012.751620,6,"AbstractThe bulk of research to date on diffusion of innovations and the user acceptance of computing technology has focused on modelling the factors that lead to a user's decision to adopt and use a technology, instead of how individuals use technology and experience it after adoption. The current paper explores how users rationalise failures in their adopted innovations; their biases in the assessment of competing technologies; and the ultimate influence of these attributions on their interpersonal word of mouth communication with other users. The findings of the research point to the mechanisms of ego enhancement and innovativeness influencing users' reactions to the failure of their adopted computing technology. Biases regarding competing technologies are, however, influenced by information presented in the mass media. Experienced users and users who are technologically innovative are more likely to exhibit biased optimism towards the technology they have adopted. When such users hear about the failure of the computing technology they have adopted, they are far more likely to blame other users for it. In contrast, less innovative, later adopters of a technology are far more likely to blame their adopted technology and consider it to be inferior.Keywords: optimistic biasthird-person effectsdiffusion of innovationsuser acceptancemarketingcomputing technology failure","['Optimism', 'Blame', 'Information technology', 'Perception', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Operating system']","['Arun Vishwanath', 'Katherine Hart LaVail']",37,False,Behaviour and Information Technology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
41 High Stress and Negative Attributional Style is Associated with Depression Symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis,2023,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355617723007129,0,"Objective: Depression is highly prevalent in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). A reformulated version of the learned helplessness theory posits that individuals who attribute the cause of negative events to personal factors (internal), perceive that the cause persists for a long period of time (stable), and believe it is present in all situations (global) are at an increased risk for depression. As such, it is critical to examine possible modifiable factors that buffer against the deleterious effects of negative attributional style. Therefore, the current study investigated whether stress moderates the relationship between negative attributional style and depression symptoms in an MS sample. Participants and Methods: Thirty-six pwMS (30 Female, 6 Male) completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and psychosocial questionnaires that assessed cognitive attributional style, daily stressors, and depression symptoms. The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) was used to create internal, stable, and global attribution dimension scores, as well as an overall attributional style score combining the three dimensions. Stress was quantified as the total score of perceived hassles from the Hassles and Uplifts Scale (HUS). Depression symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS). Hierarchical linear regressions were conducted with depression symptoms as the outcome variable. Each dimension of attributional style (internal, stable, global, or overall ASQ), stress, and their interactions were included as predictors. Simple effects tests were used to clarify the pattern of any significant interaction. Results: Regression analyses revealed that the interaction between overall attributional style and stress was significant (p = .025). Simple effects tests revealed that overall attributional style was associated with depression symptoms only in pwMS with high levels of stress (p = .015).

The Influence of Bullying on Positive Emotions and Their Effect as Mediators between Controllable Attributions of Success and Academic Performance,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/children10060929,2,"Academic performance (AP) is a topic of particular interest in the academic context. Attributions for academic success (AAS) have been shown to have a significant impact on AP, and more specifically internal controllable attributions (ICA) are closely linked to academic success. Similarly, positive emotions (PE) have a significant influence on AP and may in turn be influenced by bullying. This study examines the connections between ICA of academic success and AP mediated through PE in late primary and early secondary school students and analyzes the relationships between PE and bullying categories. Students (N = 562, 49.46% female, Mage = 11.6 SD = 1.2) reported on their perceptions of ICA and PE in relation to exams and their relationship with bullying through validated questionnaires. The AP was obtained as the average mark of all subjects in the immediately preceding assessment. First, a multiple linear regression analysis considering ICA and PE as predictor variables was carried out, which showed a significantly positive link between ICA and PE, between ICA and AP, and between PE and AP. Subsequently, using the SPSS macro PROCESS, a simple mediation model was implemented to quantify the effect of ICA on AP through PE in exams, and finally an ANOVA between the categories of bullying and PE was performed. The results showed a significant indirect relationship with a positive predictive relationship for AP. The model shows that PE proves to be a significant mediator between ICA and AP, and it is shown that students disengaged from bullying score higher in PE.","['Attribution', 'Mediation', 'Psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Regression analysis', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Paleontology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Biology']","['Antonio Ragusa', 'Valeria Caggiano', 'Ana Isabel Obregón-Cuesta', 'Jerónimo J.

Attribution Tests and the Editing of Seventeenth-Century Poetry,1999,https://doi.org/10.2307/3508940,24,"For Richard Bentley (1662-1742), editing was in essence a branch of stylistics. Lacking even the most rudimentary interest in the genetic relationship of sources, he directed his attention to the ratio et res ipsa of the work which were 'of greater weight than a hundred codexes'.[1] Classical texts, riddled with transmissional error, were to be perfected from a profound understanding of the author's meaning and habits of style. The editor's brilliance was displayed through the ingenuity of his emendations; nor was this so capricious a process as it is sometimes represented. Authors were assumed to use language in a way that was unique both to their age and themselves: the editor able to internalize that usus loquendi was in a position to sweep away the accretions and distortions of centuries of transmission by scribes who had lacked any such understanding. Reasoning of this kind is an accepted part of the editing of musical works and the restoration of visual art works. In the first case the principal tool is an analytic understanding of the composer's harmonic and contrapuntal practice and in the second a knowledge of brush-strokes, pigments, methods of preparing surfaces and ways of constructing a composition. Bentley, thinking along similar lines, was convinced not only that he could detect the verbal voice-leading or brush-strokes of a Horace or a Milton, but that it was his duty in cases where words or phrases in the original had been replaced by the substitutes of an inferior hand to repair the impertinence to the best of his ability.

Pre‐ and post‐training measures were administered to participants ( n = 97) attending training on ageing, dementia and people with intellectual disabilities. Results No significant effects of diagnosis or type of behaviour on attributions were found. There was a significant increase in knowledge after training ( P &lt; 0.001) and training was found to significantly decrease the attribution of controllability ( P &lt; 0.001).

Authorship Attribution and Optical Character Recognition Errors,2012,,0,"Stylometric authorship attribution is a fundamental problem. The basic idea behind the research is that one can determine the authorship of a document on the basis of cognitive and linguistic quirks that uniquely identify a person. In many cases, however, noise in the original documents can make this analysis more difficult and less reliable. We investigate the errors introduced by a typical optical character recognition (OCR) process. Using simulated (random) errors in a standard benchmark corpus, we test to see how sensitive the authorship attribution process is to character mis-recognition. Our results indicate that, while accuracy decreases measurably with noise, the decrease is not substantial. RESUME. Le probleme de l'attribution stylometrique d'auteur est un probleme fondamental.

The difficulty of standardising human behaviour during service delivery at a level expected by customers is exacerbated by the simultaneity of production and consumption. When service failures occur, the presence of customers leaves little scope for corrective action without the customer being aware of the mishap. The difficulty in avoiding visible service failures does not have to result in dissatisfied customers, however. Service firms can go a long way towards turning dissatisfied customers who have had a negative service experience into ones who are likely to remain loyal to the firm. That, however, requires an effective service recovery programme. This study pursued two objectives. The empirical results show that attribution (the firm accepting blame) is, relatively speaking, the dimension most important to customers in their assessment of the service recovery effort, followed by empowerment and apology. Once a service failure has occurred, customers prefer to deal with staff who are empowered to solve their problem quickly and they do not want to hear that someone else is to blame. An apology in person or, alternatively, by telephone is preferable. Surprisingly, pre‐service failure perceptions do not influence the customer’s satisfaction with the recovery effort, suggesting that service recovery is situation‐specific.","['Service recovery', 'Service guarantee', 'Marketing', 'Blame', 'Business', 'Service (business)', 'Empowerment', 'Service level objective', 'Service delivery framework', 'Service design', 'Production (economics)', 'Service quality', 'Economics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Economic growth', 'Macroeconomics']","['Christo Boshoff', 'Jason Leong']",63,False,International Journal of Service Industry Management,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
FOLK ATTRIBUTIONS OF UNDERSTANDING: IS THERE A ROLE FOR EPISTEMIC LUCK?,2016,https://doi.org/10.1017/epi.2016.38,6,"Abstract As a strategy for exploring the relationship between understanding and knowledge, we consider whether epistemic luck – which is typically thought to undermine knowledge – undermines understanding. Questions about the etiology of understanding have also been at the heart of recent theoretical debates within epistemology. Kvanvig (2003) put forward the argument that there could be lucky understanding and produced an example that he deemed persuasive. Grimm (2006) responded with a case that, he argued, demonstrated that there could not be lucky understanding. In this paper, we empirically examine how participants' patterns of understanding attributions line up with the predictions of Kvanvig and Grimm. We argue that the data challenge Kvanvig's position. People do not differentiate between knowing-why and understanding-why on the basis of proper etiology: attributions of knowledge and understanding involve comparable (and minimal) roles for epistemic luck. We thus posit that folk knowledge and understanding are etiologically symmetrical.","['Luck', 'Attribution', 'Epistemology', 'Argument (complex analysis)', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy of science', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Internal medicine']","['Daniel A.

An open‐set size‐adjusted <scp>B</scp>ayesian classifier for authorship attribution,2013,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22877,5,"Recent studies of authorship attribution have used machine‐learning methods including regularized multinomial logistic regression, neural nets, support vector machines, and the nearest shrunken centroid classifier to identify likely authors of disputed texts. These methods are all limited by an inability to perform open‐set classification and account for text and corpus size. We propose a customized B ayesian logit‐normal‐beta‐binomial classification model for supervised authorship attribution. The model is based on the beta‐binomial distribution with an explicit inverse relationship between extra‐binomial variation and text size. The model internally estimates the relationship of extra‐binomial variation to text size, and uses M arkov C hain M onte C arlo ( MCMC ) to produce distributions of posterior authorship probabilities instead of point estimates. We illustrate the method by training the machine‐learning methods as well as the open‐set B ayesian classifier on undisputed papers of The Federalist , and testing the method on documents historically attributed to A lexander H amilton, J ohn J ay, and J ames M adison.

EmailProfiler: Spearphishing Filtering with Header and Stylometric Features of Emails,2016,https://doi.org/10.1109/compsac.2016.105,55,"Spearphishing is a prominent targeted attack vector in today's Internet. By impersonating trusted email senders through carefully crafted messages and spoofed metadata, adversaries can trick victims into launching attachments containing malicious code or into clicking on malicious links that grant attackers a foothold into otherwise well-protected networks. Spearphishing is effective because it is fundamentally difficult for users to distinguish legitimate emails from spearphishing emails without additional defensive mechanisms. However, such mechanisms, such as cryptographic signatures, have found limited use in practice due to their perceived difficulty of use for normal users. In this paper, we present a novel automated approach to defending users against spearphishing attacks. The approach first builds probabilistic models of both email metadata and stylometric features of email content. Then, subsequent emails are compared to these models to detect characteristic indicators of spearphishing attacks. Several instantiations of this approach are possible, including performing model learning and evaluation solely on the receiving side, or senders publishing models that can be checked remotely by the receiver. Our evaluation of a real data set drawn from 20 email users demonstrates that the approach effectively discriminates spearphishing attacks from legitimate email while providing significant ease-of-use benefits over traditional defenses.","['Computer science', 'Metadata', 'Phishing', 'Computer security', 'World Wide Web', 'The Internet', 'Header', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Bloom filter', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer network', 'Programming language']","['Sevtap Duman', 'Kubra Kalkan-Cakmakci', 'Manuel Egele', 'William Robertson', 'Engin Kirda']",27,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
The Effects of Attribution Style and Helplessness on the Adoption of a Privacy Protective Response,2013,https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2013.14707abstract,0,"This study examines how attribution style and helplessness influence individuals' intentions to adopt a privacy protective response. Drawing upon the theory of attribution we develop a research model and posit that, in the context of information privacy, the external and stable attribution style leads to a state of helplessness about privacy protection. Helplessness, in turn, lowers individuals' intentions to remove their private information from a website. We also propose direct and moderating effects on key constructs such as Internet privacy concerns and privacy risk perceptions. Longitudinal data collected from undergraduate students provide support for most hypotheses. As predicted, the external-stable attribution style is associated with increased levels of helplessness, Internet privacy concerns, and privacy risk perceptions. Helplessness, as hypothesized, is negatively related to intention to remove private information from a website. Internet privacy concerns are positively related to privacy risk perceptions, which in turn explain intention to remove private information from a website. This provides new insights into the privacy paradox, where individuals fail to protect their private information despite their privacy concerns.

Depressive attributional style.,1979,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-843x.88.3.242,1080,"Depressed college students, compared to nondepressed college students, attributed bad outcomes to internal, stable, and global causes, as measured by an attributional style scale. This attributional style was predicted by the reformulated helplessness model of depression. In addition, relative to nondepressed students, depressed students attributed good outcomes to external, unstable causes. Recently, Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale (1978) proposed an attributional reformulation of the learned helplessness hypothesis. This reformulation resolves a number of the inadequacies of the original hypothesis when applied to human helplessness and depression. According to the reformulated hypothesis, the kinds of causal attributions people make for lack of control influence whether their helplessness will entail low selfesteem and whether their helplessness will generalize across situations and time. Abramson et al. argued that three attributional dimensions are crucial for explaining human helplessness and depression: internal-external, stable-unstable, and global-specific. In brief, the reformulated model asserts that attributing lack of control to internal factors leads to lowered self-esteem, whereas attributing lack of control to external factors does not.

Nous fonctionnerons en trois temps : le premier partira d’un article pionnier de Combettes à propos du rapport entre discours rapporté et énonciation, « Discours rapporté et énonciation : trois approches différentes », pour ensuite traiter des apports des recherches d’Authier-Revuz et de Rabatel, notamment dans La Représentation du discours autre et dans « L’effacement énonciatif dans les discours rapportés et ses effets pragmatiques ». Il sera question, dans un troisième temps, de dégager une position pragma-énonciative originale à partir de ces différentes perspectives afin de repenser les subtilités du fonctionnement de l’allo-attribution.

The results suggest that staff have knowledge of ageing at a similar level to that of college students.

Care staff attributions toward self-injurious behaviour exhibited by adults with intellectual disabilities,2007,https://doi.org/10.1177/1744629507073998,26,"Challenging behaviours may elicit negative emotional reactions and increase stress within care staff. The Leeds Attributional Coding System (LACS) was used to elicit spontaneous causal attributions of staff toward hypothetical clients with challenging behaviours. It was hypothesized that there would be relationships (1) between staff exposure to challenging behaviours and burnout, and (2) between staff cognitions and burnout. Using a cross-sectional correlational design, 41 care staff took part in a 10 minute interview about two vignettes depicting self-injurious behaviour. Staff also completed measures of demographic information and burnout. Participants made attributions toward self-injurious behaviour that were typically internal to the client, uncontrollable, unstable and specific.There was a significant association between number of clients cared for and emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment. Staff who made fewer stable attributions had higher levels of burnout. There were no other relationships found between staff cognition and burnout. The LACS can be successfully employed in this context, and may have some benefits over other methods. Future research is required to explore the relationship between cognition and burnout.","['Burnout', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Emotional exhaustion', 'Challenging behaviour', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Occupational burnout', 'Intellectual disability', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Paleontology', 'Biology']","['Elizabeth Snow', 'Peter E.

In mediation, parties who make attribution seek to take control of the mediation process so that they can gain advantage of the situation. Although attribution theories have enriched the study of social cognitive processes and communication competence, they have not been studied in the context of mediation. Yet these are powerful communication processes that affect parties' movements toward an amicable settlement in mediation.

Libra-CAM: An Activation-Based Attribution Based on the Linear Approximation of Deep Neural Nets and Threshold Calibration,2022,https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/442,0,"Universal application of AI has increased the need to explain why an AI model makes a specific decision in a human-understandable form. Among many related works, the class activation map (CAM)-based methods have been successful recently, creating input attribution based on the weighted sum of activation maps in convolutional neural networks. However, existing methods use channel-wise importance weights with specific architectural assumptions, relying on arbitrarily chosen attribution threshold values in their quality assessment: we think these can degrade the quality of attribution. In this paper, we propose Libra-CAM, a new CAM-style attribution method based on the best linear approximation of the layer (as a function) between the penultimate activation and the target-class score output. From the approximation, we derive the base formula of Libra-CAM, which is applied with multiple reference activations from a pre-built library. We construct Libra-CAM by averaging these base attribution maps, taking a threshold calibration procedure to optimize its attribution quality. Our experiments show that Libra-CAM can be computed in a reasonable time and is superior to the existing attribution methods in quantitative and qualitative attribution quality evaluations.","['Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Calibration', 'Artificial neural network', 'Class (philosophy)', 'Construct (python library)', 'Quality (philosophy)', 'Base (topology)', 'Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Psychology', 'Statistics', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Programming language']","['Sangkyun Lee', 'Sungmin Han']",28,True,Proceedings of the Thirty-First International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

This source stands out because it is the only one written in Palumbi’s hand that records his guitar songs in staff notation—his other manuscripts are notated only with alfabeto chord symbols. Building on our present knowledge of Palumbi, the article establishes his Neapolitan identity and his presence as a guitar maestro in Florence, perhaps as early as the 1590s, quite early in the era that marked the Spanish guitar’s popularity in Italy. This information allows for an entirely new assessment of Palumbi’s extensive repertory, which until now was thought only to exist in manuscripts inscribed with alfabeto. Measuring Palumbi’s alfabeto-texts against his settings with staff notation, I consider some details of his ‘song-writing’ process. In particular, I show how Palumbi’s guitar songs reflect improvisational practices such as fabordón, which may assist modern performers in the realization of those of his songs which are notated solely as alfabeto-texts, whose melodies are otherwise irrecoverably lost.","['Guitar', 'Melody', 'Chord (peer-to-peer)', 'Vibrato', 'Improvisation', 'Polyphony', 'Art', 'Identity (music)', 'Literature', 'Visual arts', 'Notation', 'Blues', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Musical', 'Aesthetics', 'Singing', 'Art history', 'Philosophy', 'Acoustics', 'Physics', 'Distributed computing']",['Cory M.

We theorize and find support for a relationship between higher attributional complexity and transformational leadership behaviours, based on a sample of 100 leaders and their direct reports. Leaders who were more complex in their social judgments, attributing complex external and internal causes to others' behaviours and actions, were seen as more transformational by their direct reports. Our findings suggest that attributional complexity is a construct that warrants consideration in future research on both transformational leadership and leadership attributions.","['Transformational leadership', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Construct (python library)', 'Social psychology', 'Transactional leadership', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['Peter Y.

Supporting intrinsic motivation and learning-friendly attributions in German student–teacher-conferences,2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/03004279.2023.2199775,1,"ABSTRACTPromoting students’ motivation to learn and supporting learning-friendly attributions is an important task for teachers. While doing so is possible in the classroom every day, there are also special situations with particular formats, such as student–teacher-conferences, which can be well-suited to supporting students’ motivation to learn. German student–teacher-conferences (=German: Lernentwicklungsgespräche (LEGs); translated literally: learning development conversations) are a form of performance assessment and performance feedback in which elements of formative assessment can be implemented. This article examines whether LEGs correlate with intrinsic motivation and learning-friendly attributions when they are perceived by students as supportive of learning. For this purpose, 392 children in grade 2 (mainly at the age of 7 and 8) filled out questionnaires in a pre–post design. The results show that, from the children’s point of view, LEGs are mostly implemented in ways that learners perceive as supportive of their learning and motivation; that said, there were significant differences both between teachers and between teachers’ different LEGs. In addition, we observed a relationship between LEGs, intrinsic motivation and learning-friendly attributions, although it was depended on the children’s perspective of how the LEGs were implemented.KEYWORDS: Student–teacher-conferencesLernentwicklungsgesprächeformative assessmentmotivationattribution Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 Ertl et al.

However, several recent empirical studies have found significant gaps between the HR practices that organizations report using and employees' experiences of those HR practices, raising a question about the extent to which organizationally intended HR practices are effectively implemented within an organization. Drawing on attribution theory, we address this problem by focusing on the role of frontline managers (FLMs) in implementing commitment HR practices. Data collected from 195 employees in 61 work groups in two time periods showed that FLMs' commitment HR attributions affected their implementation of commitment HR practices, which in turn affected employees' perceptions of HR practice implementation and the average level of organizational citizenship behavior in their work group. The findings contribute to the strategic HRM literature by demonstrating the significant role of FLMs' attributions in attaining the unrealized potential benefits of commitment HR practices through the effective implementation of commitment HR practices.","['Attribution', 'Organizational citizenship behavior', 'Organizational commitment', 'Human resource management', 'Perception', 'Line management', 'Human resources', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Best practice', 'Organizational culture', 'Work (physics)', 'Public relations', 'Knowledge management', 'Social psychology', 'Management', 'Political science', 'Engineering', 'Computer science', 'Neuroscience', 'Economics', 'Mechanical engineering']","['Jaewan Yang', 'Jeffrey B.

Study 2 analyzed some of the data collected from an experiment and provided further evidence supporting the effects by showing that women's Agreen-ad was more positive than men's because of the different levels of SKEP across gender. Through introducing and testing motive attribution as a mediator, the study also offered some insight into the mechanism of the SKEP effect on Agreen-ad, i.e., consumers with higher SKEP will more likely attribute the green ad motive to for-profit marketing tactics rather than for-environment efforts, and that in turn will generate negative Agreen-ad. Agreen-ad was diagnosed as unidimensional, but when tested separately, the utilitarian dimension was found to be more vulnerable to the effects of gender and SKEP.","['Skepticism', 'Attribution', 'Advertising', 'Psychology', 'Profit (economics)', 'Social psychology', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Epistemology', 'Microeconomics', 'Philosophy']",['Jason Jusheng Yu'],80,False,Journal of Marketing Communications,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Resilience is one of the empowering factor to alleviate the negative effects of stressors and adversities, to comply with the new situations and to think in realistic way. When considered this point of view, self-attribution bias in financial decision and resilience relation could be an important subject. Background There is no any scientific work about the subject of the self-attribution bias in financial decision and resilience relation. In this study it is aslo analyzed the effect of resilience trainings on self attribution bias and resilience. Purpose/Aim One of the aims of this work is to invesitegate the self-attribution bias in financial decision and resilience correlation. The other aim is to find an evidence of how the self-attribution bias in financial decision and resilience changes with resilience centered trainings. Scope/Method For this reason individual self-attribution bias and resilience scores are measured. In order to measure the self attribution bias, specific statemens about the bias are conducted. To evaluate the resilience scores, The Turkish version of the Resilience Scale for Adults is used. Results The results show firstly, there is a negative relation between the self attribution bias and the resilience. Secondly it is seen that, the self attribution bias scores are decreased and the resilience scores are increased after the resilience centered trainings. Conclusions Importantly, our results provide the evidence about the relation of self attribution bias and resilience and the effect of resilience centered trainings on these factors. On the other hand, it is needed more research studies to validate and understand these findings.","['Attribution', 'Resilience (materials science)', 'Psychology', 'Psychological resilience', 'Attribution bias', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Thermodynamics']",['Çağrı Hamurcu'],21,True,Fiscaoeconomia,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

A Linguistic Analysis of Authorship Attribution in E-Commerce Scams’ Promotional Contents and Narratives,2023,https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i1/16243,2,"The emergence of e-commerce or online shopping platform has opened-up multiple opportunities for business owners to multiply their earnings. At the same time, this enables consumers to shop conveniently compared to the traditional shopping method, especially during the Covid19 pandemic. In Malaysia, the development opens consumers to the novel threat of fraud and scams, especially on social media and other online shopping platforms such as Shopee, Lazada and Facebook Marketplace. Due to the alarming rise in scams worldwide and the elusive methods offenders use, law enforcement agencies have turned to public education and awareness programs to reduce the number of scam victims. Thus, this study aims to identify authors' attributes in e-commerce scams' promotional contents and narratives to examine the scammers' persuasive strategies to deceive their victims. Specifically, the study intends to look at the linguistic features in authorship attribution, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, structural, and content-specific features of the corpus. Although linguistic analysis has never been used in cybersecurity, learning the language used by scammers could help researchers collect more comprehensive empirical data and educate the public about this common phenomenon.","['Narrative', 'Social media', 'Attribution', 'Law enforcement', 'Linguistic analysis', 'Internet privacy', 'Public relations', 'Advertising', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Computer science', 'World Wide Web', 'Linguistics', 'Social psychology', 'Law', 'Philosophy']","['Nursyaidatul Kamar Md Shah', 'Ameiruel Azwan Ab Aziz', 'Aminabibi Saidalvi']",20,True,International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The present research aims to test the Weiner model in Brazil, a country with established subcultures and clear distinctions in the collectivism-individualism dimension across its regions. An experiment with 1,569 participants from all five Brazilian regions was conducted. Path analysis revealed that more socially oriented participants tended to feel more compassion for the experimental scenario's protagonist, independent of controllability manipulation, decreasing the effect of emotions in the model.

Attributions were found to influence goals both directly and through the mediation of emotion, though the character of this influence depended strongly on the goal.

The children's, parents', and teachers' attributional patterns were compared, and the children's pattern was checked against Weiner's attributional model. The results in general show that children and teachers tend to play down the importance of reasons that relate misbehavior directly to themselves and attribute much importance to reasons external to themselves. Parents, on the other hand, tend to attribute similar degrees of importance to reasons related to the misbehaving child, to the teacher, to other children, and to the child's environment, as well as to themselves.

In all three studies, self-serving bias was revealed by the greater overall self-attribution for positive rather than negative outcomes and an interaction between type of situation and nature of outcome appeared primarily because of the reverse (‘self-disserving’) bias shown for the lottery situation, presumably because of its lopsided controllability. As predicted, high private self-conscious subjects made overall greater self-attributions and also showed overall less self-serving bias. Public self-consciousness and social anxiety did not significantly affect self-attributions, possibly because of the relatively ‘asocial’ nature of the situations.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Attribution bias', 'Self-consciousness', 'Social psychology', 'Personality', 'Consciousness', 'Social anxiety', 'Anxiety', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Communication', 'Psychiatry']","['Asma Shaherwalla', 'Suresh Kanekar']",23,False,The Irish Journal of Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Source attributions of pollution to the Western Arctic during the NASA ARCTAS field campaign,2013,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-4707-2013,81,"Abstract. We use the NASA GEOS-5 transport model with tagged tracers to investigate the contributions of different regional sources of CO and black carbon (BC) to their concentrations in the Western Arctic (i.e., 50–90° N and 190–320° E) in spring and summer 2008. The model is evaluated by comparing the results with airborne measurements of CO and BC from the NASA Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) field campaigns to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of our simulations. We also examine the reliability of tagged CO tracers in characterizing air mass origins using the measured fossil fuel tracer of dichloromethane and the biomass burning tracer of acetonitrile. Our tagged CO simulations suggest that most of the enhanced CO concentrations (above background level from CH4 production) observed during April originate from Asian anthropogenic emissions. Boreal biomass burning emissions and Asian anthropogenic emissions are of similar importance in July domain wise, although the biomass burning CO fraction is much larger in the area of the ARCTAS field experiments. The fraction of CO from Asian anthropogenic emissions is larger in spring than in summer. European sources make up no more than 10% of CO levels in the campaign domain during either period. Comparisons of CO concentrations along the flight tracks with regional averages from GEOS-5 show that the along-track measurements are representative of the concentrations within the large domain of the Western Arctic in April but not in July.","['Environmental science', 'Arctic', 'Troposphere', 'Atmospheric sciences', 'TRACER', 'Boreal', 'Biomass burning', 'Air pollution', 'The arctic', 'Climatology', 'Oceanography', 'Meteorology', 'Aerosol', 'Geography', 'Chemistry', 'Geology', 'Physics', 'Archaeology', 'Organic chemistry', 'Nuclear physics']","['Huisheng Bian', 'Peter R.

"Authorial Attribution and Computational Stylistics: if you can tell authors apart, have you learned anything about them?",1998,,0,"Within stylometrics, the disciplines of authorial attribution and descriptive stylistics hitherto have been pursued separately. The first has achieved mainstream status within literary studies, while the second is little recognized. A study of the plays of Thomas Middleton compared with a large control sample shows that it is possible to achieve a good classification of his work in 2,000 word segments as against those of his contemporaries, using frequencies of very common words. Such a result can serve as the basis both for testing Middleton's hand in some disputed plays and for a description of his style. Most of «The Revenger's Tragedy», part of «The Yorkshire Tragedy», and all of «The Second Maiden's Tragedy» prove to be in a style similar to that of Middleton's uncontested plays. This style, judging by an examination of instances in context of the ten word types most strongly correlated with the Middleton-other discriminant function, is (among other things) rich in deictics and poor in conjunctions, features readily accommodated to previous descriptions including Middleton's own.

Protective and Exacerbating Cognition and Attribution Factors From the Cognitive Discrepancy Theory of Loneliness,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab046.150,0,"Abstract According to the cognitive discrepancy theory, although the discrepancy between actual and desired social resources may result in loneliness, Perlman and Peplau (1998) suggested that cognitive processing and attributional style also impact the interpretation of social information. Previous empirical research investigating predictors of loneliness have not assessed a wide range of cognition and attribution factors, so this study filled this gap by examining how protective (optimism, sense of mastery, and purpose in life) and exacerbating (depression, control constraints, negative self-perceptions of aging (SPA), and experiences of age-based discrimination) factors influence and moderate the experience of loneliness cross-sectionally and longitudinally using a sample of 3,345 Americans aged 50 years and older from the 2008 and 2012 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. Optimism (βs = -.15, -.13), mastery (βs = -.08, -.07), purpose in life (βs = -.19, -.18), depression (βs = .22,.14), control constraints (βs = .18, .17), negative SPA (βs = .13, .14), and experiences of ageism (βs = .07, .06) were significantly related to loneliness cross-sectionally and longitudinally, respectively. Optimism buffered the negative impact of poor functional social resources (e.g., low social support) on loneliness cross-sectionally while control constraints, negative SPA, and experiencing ageism exacerbated the relationship between low functional social resources and loneliness cross-sectionally. None of the protective or exacerbating factors modulated the relationship between functional social resources and loneliness longitudinally. These findings have important implications for the development of interventions that target loneliness. Targeting maladaptive cognitions may be particularly effective in reducing loneliness.","['Loneliness', 'Psychology', 'Optimism', 'Attribution', 'Cognition', 'Psychological intervention', 'Social cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry']",['Jillian Minahan Zucchetto'],0,True,Innovation in Aging,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
The impact of attributions in marriage: a longitudinal analysis.,1987,,159,"In this study, we investigate the longitudinal relation between attributions for relationship events and marital satisfaction. Thirty-four couples were assessed at two points separated by approximately 12 months. Causal and responsibility attributions for marital difficulties and negative spouse behaviors were strongly related to concurrent marital satisfaction. For wives, later marital satisfaction was predicted by both causal and responsibility attributions after the effects of earlier satisfaction were removed. For husbands, attributions did not predict later marital satisfaction. Marital satisfaction did not predict later attributions for either husbands or wives. Marital satisfaction and the two types of attributions were related to concurrent unrealistic relationship expectations, but these expectations did not predict later marital satisfaction. The results are discussed in terms of a possible causal relation between attributions and marital satisfaction.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Spouse', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology']","['Frank D.

Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution,2020,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42400-020-00048-4,34,"Abstract The attribution of cyber attacks is often neglected. The consensus still is that little can be done to prosecute the perpetrators – and unfortunately, this might be right in many cases. What is however only of limited interest for the private industry is in the center of interest for nation states. Investigating if an attack was carried out in the name of a nation state is a crucial task for secret services. Many methods, tools and processes exist for network- and computer forensics that allow the collection of traces and evidences. They are the basis to associate adversarial actions to threat actors. However, a serious problem which has not got the appropriate attention from research yet, are false flag campaigns, cyber attacks which apply covert tactics to deceive or misguide attribution attempts – either to hide traces or to blame others. In this paper we provide an overview of prominent attack techniques along the cyber kill chain. We investigate traces left by attack techniques and which questions in course of the attribution process are answered by investigating these traces. Eventually, we assess how easily traces can be spoofed and rate their relevancy with respect to identifying false flag campaigns.","['Computer security', 'Blame', 'Covert', 'Spoofing attack', 'Computer science', 'Attribution', 'Adversarial system', 'Process (computing)', 'Task (project management)', 'Flag (linear algebra)', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Engineering', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Systems engineering', 'Operating system', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Algebra over a field']","['Florian Skopik', 'Tímea Páhi']",56,True,Cybersecurity,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Attribution theory, the study of lay explanatory styles emphasizing either internal considerations — dispositional predilections of actors or external factors — broader environmental/contextual considerations — is employed in concourse compilation for two political controversies (economic inequality and electoral success in the 2016 presidential election), and two studies are reported. Results from the first demonstrate sharp differences between ideological and partisan opponents: Republican respondents display clear tendencies to employ dispositional attributions in accounting for economic inequality, praising the well-to-do as diligent and deserving for their success while denigrating the poor for their failure to compete in free-market capitalism. The second study amplifies and extends these findings by comparing Republican and Democratic accounts of the 2016 election results. Again, those on the Right are found to overdo dispositional attributions in a manner consistent with the “fundamental attribution error” first identified by Fritz Heider and extended by Thomas Pettigrew to inter-group prejudice as “the ultimate attribution error.” A concluding discussion seeks to contextualize these partisan-based differences with reference to the divisive nature of President Trump’s leadership while identifying a way forward for further research.","['Attribution', 'Ideology', 'Politics', 'Motivated reasoning', 'Positive economics', 'Presidential system', 'Social psychology', 'Democracy', 'Polarization (electrochemistry)', 'Political economy', 'Sociology', 'Political science', 'Psychology', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Chemistry', 'Physical chemistry']","['Robert Léonard', 'Daniel Sundblad', 'Dan B.

The method is then applied to the classical question of the stylistic affinity between two 13th century texts: Heimskringla and Egils saga.

Attribution theory, which describes how and why people ascribe causes to events and behaviors, can provide a useful framework for helping researchers in their quest to understand how and why victims and observers respond as they do to cataclysmic events. In spite of its clear potential for guiding research, surprisingly few studies looking at disaster and nearly no studies of terrorism have used an attributional perspective. While other negative life crises have been studied, cataclysmic events such as disasters and terrorist attacks possess distinctive features that set them apart from other types of trauma.

Based on exchange theory, it was expected that greater caregiver resentment would be associated with feeling underbenefited in the relationship and with an orientation to relationships that did not focus on the needs of the partner (communal), but did focus on “tit‐for‐tat” reciprocity (exchange). It was also expected that those caregivers who were more likely to get their needs satisfied in the relationship before the cardiac incident would be more resentful at giving care. Finally, based on attributional theory, it was predicted that caregivers who thought that their spouses were not taking responsibility for improving their health would be more resentful. As predicted, more resentful caregivers were those who felt underbenefited, were more exchange oriented, and judged that their partners were not working toward improving their health. In addition, only those with a low communal orientation toward their spouse showed a relationship between feeling underbenefited and resentment. The needs centrality prediction was not supported. The findings illustrate the utility of applying theories developed in the close relationship area to the understanding of caregiving with chronically ill populations.","['Resentment', 'Feeling', 'Spouse', 'Psychology', 'Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)', 'Social psychology', 'Social exchange theory', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Anthropology', 'Law']","['Suzanne C.

In the first study, we consider how children at the ages of four and six reason about person by situation covariation information (Kelley, 1967), both younger than previously demonstrated trait biases or spontaneously using trait words. We then compare children's explanations of people's behavior to the actual behavioral evidence. Next, we extend the paradigm to include physical causation and the potential overhypotheses that guide the formation of domain specific reasoning. We will determine whether there are domain differences in perceiving virtually identical data construed as physical events or intentional actions. And finally, in the last study, we examine the role of culture in shaping the developmental trajectory of attributional style. As in physical causal inference, social causal inference combines covariational evidence and prior knowledge. We can use the tools of causal inference to understand how culturally-mediated prior beliefs affect the construal of person-by-situation information in a domain specific manner and trace the origins of attributional biases in adults.","['Causal inference', 'Attribution', 'Causal reasoning', 'Psychology', 'Inference', 'Causation', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Trait', 'Construal level theory', 'Social cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Epistemology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience', 'Economics', 'Econometrics', 'Programming language']",['Elizabeth Anne Seiver'],49,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The Power of Love: The Role of Emotional Attributions and Standards in Heterosexuals' Attitudes toward Lesbian and Gay Couples,2015,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/sov047,22,"Do people attribute emotions differently to members of various social groups? If so, do these differences have any bearing on formal and informal forms of social recognition? Using data from a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine whether American heterosexuals differentially attribute love to lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples. We also examine the relationship between how in love lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples are perceived to be and attitudes toward (1) granting them partnership benefits (formal rights); (2) the acceptability of their public displays of affection (informal privileges); and (3) marriage. Three main findings suggest that heterosexuals differentially attribute love to different types of romantic couples and that these differences are related to willingness to grant social recognition. First, gay couples are viewed as less loving than both heterosexual and lesbian couples; lesbian couples are seen as equally loving as heterosexual couples. Second, perceptions of love are related to willingness to grant social recognition. Third, perceptions of love matter more for gay and, to a lesser extent, lesbian couples than for heterosexual couples regarding informal privileges and marriage. In contrast, love matters equally for same-sex and heterosexual couples regarding formal rights. The results show that gay couples are penalized most in terms of perceptions of love and social recognition, whereas lesbians occupy a liminal space between heterosexual and gay couples. Collectively, these findings suggest that sexual identity and gender shape emotional attributions, which in turn play a key role in explaining inequalities that same-sex couples face.","['Lesbian', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Affection', 'Perception', 'Attribution', 'Gender studies', 'Sociology', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Neuroscience']","['Long Doan', 'Lisa R.

Attribution Stigma and Contagion: How Did the Art Auction Market React to Australian “Black Art Scandals”?,2021,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3934138,1,"In 1999, two major stories hit the media concerning the authenticity of artworks by two of Australia’s leading Indigenous artists: Turkey Tolson Tjupurrala and Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, both artists of the Western Desert region. The incidents were quickly tagged as ‘Black art scandals’, with the artists disavowing production of the art¬¬works in question. In the case of works attributed to Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, there was eventually an arrest and criminal trial of his dealer. For Turkey Tolson Tjupurrala, the situation was more complicated, involving what we call ‘family attribution’. We theorise the market impacts using the lens of stigma, given that, in the art market, uncovering fakes and forgeries may create a panic among buyers of an artist. Our proposed mechanism is that negative media attention about works misattributed to an artist stigmatises the artist’s name and their artworks. We also note the potential stigma transfer to other artists in a style or genre (category-level contagion). Using data from the Australian Art Sales Digest for auctions containing artworks by Australian Indigenous artists (1998–2000), we investigate the auction market reaction to these misattribution scandals. We indeed find a decline in both the clearance rate and value of sales for auctions occurring after the news stories broke.","['Attribution', 'Stigma (botany)', 'Economics', 'Advertising', 'Business', 'Political science', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Erica Coslor', 'Tim R.

Questions of Attribution: Registered Designs at The National Archives,2013,https://doi.org/10.1093/jdh/ept007,2,"The registered designs held at The National Archives, the UK government’s archive in Kew, South West London, form a rich and unique resource for studying design history that has yet to be fully explored. Looking at designs registered for copyright between 1842 and 1883, in particular those relating to interior design—including wallpapers, furnishing textiles and ceramics—this article shows how the material, including many thousands of drawings, photographs and samples, fits within the wider context of the nineteenth-century design reform movement. Debates around the quality of design, public taste and the education of designers, which resulted in the setting up of the Schools of Design and the South Kensington Museum, also led to the series of design copyright acts that gave rise to this collection. The article looks at the difficulties involved in attributing the designs and the position of anonymous designers working for big manufacturers, and gives examples of The National Archives’ holdings of wallpaper, textile, ceramic and furniture designs by leading names in the design reform movement, including A. W. N. Pugin, Owen Jones, Bruce Talbert, E. W. Godwin, William Morris, Walter Crane and Christopher Dresser.

Influencing expert judgment: Attributions of crime causality,2010,https://doi.org/10.1348/135532510x490183,11,"Purpose. The present research aimed to investigate the effects of attribution on expert clinical judgment in comparison to semi‐experts and laypeople. Two research questions were addressed. First, would experts be less subject to attributional manipulations, in terms of their perceived ratings of dangerousness, than would semi‐experts or laypeople? Second, would experts be less subject to attributional manipulations, in terms of their assessments of offender responsibility, than would semi‐experts or laypeople? Method. A 3×3×2 mixed groups design was implemented. Participants read nine crime scenarios that had been internally or externally manipulated. For each scenario, participants were asked to rate offender dangerousness, offender responsibility, and the seriousness of the crime and to suggest a suitable sentence length. Targeted recruitment was employed, yielding 12 experts, 21 semi‐experts, and 22 laypeople. Results. Offenders were considered to be more responsible for their actions and more dangerous to others in the internal manipulations than in the external ones across all crime types and by all levels of expertise. Findings indicate that semi‐experts are less subject to the influence of attributional manipulations than both experts and laypeople. Marked similarities in the pattern of expert and lay person judgments can be observed from the present analyses. Conclusions. The current findings lend support to previous research in the area in that similarities between expert and lay person judgment were observed. However, through expanding and clarifying the levels of expertise investigated, the current findings highlight the need for greater research into the distinct ‘semi‐expert’ group.","['Seriousness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Subject (documents)', 'Causality (physics)', 'Sentence', 'Human factors and ergonomics', 'Applied psychology', 'Poison control', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Computer science', 'Medicine', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Library science', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Environmental health']","['Jennifer Murray', 'Mary E.

The insights from this appraisal are then used to present a conceptual framework for determining the optimal execution schedule for orders where alpha capture is not a relevant consideration. In the concluding section, this framework is applied to formulate new benchmarks, based on participation rates, for evaluating the quality of execution and the measurement of market impact, namely, the negligible impact participation rate (NIPR) and the optimal trajectory participation rate (OTPR).

Hidden Authors and Reading Machines: Investigating 19th-century authorship with 21st-century technologies,2017,,0,"The centrality of authorship in literary studies has been under attack since at least the publication of Roland Barthes’ “The Death of the Author” and of Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?”. Yet Digital Humanities methods such as computational authorship attribution or “stylometry” seem to give new prominence to authorship as a critical category. There is an understandable unease among book historians and literary scholars about the emergence of these technology-driven methods. Some see the recent rise to prominence of stylometry and other “distant reading” methods as heralding a rebirth of the author as a central interpretive category and a corresponding death of the reader, substituted by the machine. 

This paper will present our interrogation of the study of authorship in the era of Digital Humanities through a case study based upon our project A Question of Style: individual voices and corporate identity in the Edinburgh Review, 1814-20, which is funded by a Research Society for Victorian Periodicals Field Development grant. 

According to Jon Klancher, nineteenth-century periodicals succeeded in creating, through a “transauthorial discourse”, a unified corporate voice that hid individual authors behind an impersonal public text (Klancher 1987). In our project, we test whether 21st-century digital tools and methods can be used to further evaluate this interpretation of 19th-century authorship and publication practices. Our paper will reflect critically on the following aspects of our research: 

Can we, in Franco Moretti’s words, “operationalise” the practice of authorship in the Edinburgh Review, selecting features of its published texts that can be measured empirically with the help of 21st-century technologies such as TEI, Python and R, and of methods such as stylometry, corpus stylistics and Natural Language Processing?

The results of the review show that leaders' communication style influences the leadership attributions that emerge in virtual teams. In addition, leadership support for work-life balance can reduce employees' counterproductive behaviors by mitigating work-family conflict. Additionally, big data-driven marketing attributions can enhance customer value attribution accuracy. Furthermore, leaders' commitment to public ideals has a favorable relationship with charismatic leadership attributions and, as a result, lower turnover rates. The research results highlight how attributions significantly influence employees' reactions to policies, leaders' styles, and organizational outcomes.

Authority and Attribution in the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter,2015,https://doi.org/10.33137/rr.v38i1.22782,1,"This essay addresses the vexed question of the genre of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter by considering the framing of the psalms in the early editions printed in England and on the continent. It is undeniable that all of the producers of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter were committed to the dissemination of Scripture in the vernacular and that many were concerned with approximating the hebraica veritas. But comparing the title pages, prefaces, and marginal notes included in the sixteenth-century versions of the psalter with those of contemporary prose translations reveals that the editors of the psalter distinguished the metrical psalms from prose translations by carefully marking them as the poetic products of particular authors. In calling on the names and titles of the versifiers as sources of the volume’s authority, the editors of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter forged an understanding of poetic authorship that would prove influential not only for later psalm translators but for English poets more generally. Indeed, this essay makes the case that the practices of authorial attribution employed in the psalters may have directly influenced the presentation of more celebrated verse anthologies like Tottel’s Songes and Sonettes.&#x0D; Cet article se penche sur la question controversée du genre du psautier Sternhold and Hopkins, en examinant l’encadrement des psaumes dans les premières éditions anglaises et continentales.

Ideologies of Disadvantage: Language attributions in a Dutch multicultural primary school classroom,2009,https://doi.org/10.29302/jolie.2009.2.1.11,4,"Current ethnographic research shows that Dutch educational policy is caught between two positions.First, it constructs pupils from immigrant minority groups as educationally disadvantaged and, as a consequence, fosters mainstream (language) education as the means for their social integration and emancipation (Bezemer 2003).Second, it leaves Dutch primary school teachers with the challenge of dealing with the cultural and linguistic diversity brought about by their pupils (Bezemer & Kroon 2008;Spotti 2007).Against this background, the present article, stemming from a larger comparative ethnographic enquiry in the Netherlands and Flanders, focuses on the analysis of the discourse of a Dutch native primary school teacher in a multicultural classroom in the Netherlands.By means of socioculturally informed discourse analysis (Gee 2005), it is shown that the identities of immigrant minority pupils are constructed, in the class teacher's discourse, on the basis of language attributions that find their pivotal point in ideologies of language disadvantage provoked by the lack of Dutch language skills on the part of these pupils' parents.The analysis, however, indicates that at the level of the discourse that populates the classroom, the ideologies that lay beneath the language attributions through which these pupils' identities are constructed are eroding.Such erosion might also hold consequences for the way in which immigrant minority pupils' identities are constructed in the discourse of Dutch governmental institutions.","['Disadvantage', 'Ideology', 'Multiculturalism', 'Attribution', 'Sociology', 'Language ideology', 'Pedagogy', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Social psychology', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Law']","['Massimiliano Spotti', 'Sjaak Kroon']",34,False,Journal of Linguistic and Intercultural Education,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The effects of the psychiatric label ‘borderline personality disorder’ on nursing staff's perceptions and causal attributions for challenging behaviours,2003,https://doi.org/10.1348/01446650360703366,167,"The aim of the study was to investigate how the psychiatric label 'borderline personality disorder' (BPD) affected staff's perceptions and causal attributions about patients' behaviour.The study utilized a within-participants questionnaire methodology and participants comprised qualified mental health nursing staff. The questionnaire contained descriptions of challenging behaviour in which the patient was described with a diagnosis of depression, schizophrenia or BPD. Participants were asked to identify a likely cause of the behaviour and then on a Likert-type scale rate attributions of internality, stability, globality and controllability. In addition they recorded their level of sympathy with the patient and their optimism for change.Patients with a label of BPD attracted more negative responses from staff than those with a label of schizophrenia or depression. Causes of their negative behaviour were rated as more stable and they were thought to be more in control of the causes of the behaviour and the behaviour itself. Staff reported less sympathy and optimism towards patients with a diagnosis of BPD and rated their personal experiences as more negative than their experiences of working with patients with a diagnosis of depression or schizophrenia.Staff regard patients with a BPD label to be more in control of negative behaviour than patients with a label of schizophrenia or depression. In accord with Weiner's (1985) model, attributions of control were inversely related to staff sympathy. Addressing attributions of control may provide a means to modify staff sympathy towards patients with a diagnosis of BPD and counteract their negative experiences.","['Sympathy', 'Attribution', 'Borderline personality disorder', 'Psychology', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Optimism', 'Psychiatry', 'Personality', 'Depression (economics)', 'Anger', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Dominic Markham', 'Peter Trower']",0,False,British Journal of Clinical Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

"How Audiences Engage With Drama: Identification, Attribution and Moral Approval",2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.762011,3,"Fictional storytelling has played an important role in human cultural life since earliest times, and we are willing to invest significant quantities of time, mental effort and money in it. Nonetheless, the psychological mechanisms that make this possible, and how they relate to the mechanisms that underpin real-world social relationships, remain understudied. We explore three factors: identification (the capacity to identify with a character), moral approval and causal attribution with respect to a character’s behaviour in live performances of two plays from the European literary canon. There were significant correlations between the extent to which subjects identified with a character and their moral approval of that character’s behaviour that was independent of the way the play was directed. However, the subjects’ psychological explanations for a character’s behaviour (attribution) were independent of whether or not they identified with, or morally approved of, the character. These data extend previous findings by showing that moral approval plays an important role in facilitating identification even in live drama. Despite being transported by an unfolding drama, audiences do not necessarily become biased in their psychological understanding of why characters behaved as they did. The psychology of drama offers significant insights into the psychological processes that underpin our everyday social world.","['Drama', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Identification (biology)', 'Character (mathematics)', 'Social psychology', 'Moral character', 'Storytelling', 'Narrative', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Botany', 'Biology', 'Geometry', 'Mathematics']","['Ben Teasdale', 'Laurie Maguire', 'Felix Budelmann', 'R.

To address this issue, we introduce IDTraffickers, an extensive dataset consisting of 87,595 text ads and 5,244 vendor labels to enable the verification and identification of potential HT vendors on online escort markets. To establish a benchmark for authorship identification, we train a DeCLUTR-small model, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.8656 in a closed-set classification environment. Next, we leverage the style representations extracted from the trained classifier to conduct authorship verification, resulting in a mean r-precision score of 0.8852 in an open-set ranking environment. Finally, to encourage further research and ensure responsible data sharing, we plan to release IDTraffickers for the authorship attribution task to researchers under specific conditions, considering the sensitive nature of the data.

Individuals high in attributional sensitivity scored higher on various measures of consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence than individuals low in attributional sensitivity.

Attribution of Works by Vladimir Grinberg and Alexander Vedernikov: The Problem of the Artist’s Signature,2021,https://doi.org/10.15826/izv2.2021.23.4.069,0,"This article considers the phenomenon of the authors’ signatures of Vladimir Grinberg (1896—1942) and Alexander Vedernikov (1898—1975), two representatives of the Leningrad Landscape School community in the 1930s—1940s. During this period, they entered a single circle of friendly and professional communication and experienced mutual influences. The artists’ work is considered more broadly and goes beyond their participation in the community. The goal of the article is to single out the most significant periods of their activity, trace changes in the authors’ handwriting from decade to decade, pay attention to the period of apprenticeship and formation of the artists, and focus on controversial issues in the attribution of their paintings and drawings. A study of all the works by Grinberg and Vedernikov currently identified in museum and private collections, makes it possible to trace the changes in the authors’ styles and discover the artistic landmarks of the masters. Grinberg’s manner repeatedly transformed. The neoclassical stylistics of his works of the late 1910s and citation of paintings by the old masters gave way to modest still lifes in the 1920s. After landscapes and scenes of everyday life on a black background in the early 1930s, there was a lightening of the colour scheme during his work on the New Leningrad series in the middle of the decade. In the early 1940s, Grinberg began to paint very broadly, generalising and simplifying the images. This scandalising manner has parallels with the style of the 1960s. Vedernikov was influenced by the art of French post-impressionists. Also, he took interest in the art of Russian folk crafts in the post-war period, more particularly, in Gorodets painting. The article pays much attention to Grinberg’s and Vedernikov’s lithographs.

The analysis ofmanufacturing clues isdiscussed inChapter 2 in relation to books from the fifteenth to the twentieth centuries, with coverage of topics including composition, imposition, proofreading, paper and watermarks, press fi gures, and cancels. A general lesson that Tanselle draws from his survey is that twentieth-century analytical bibliographers could create problems for themselves through overeagerness to apply the study ofmanufacturing history to that of liter aryhistory. Chapter 3, on the analysis of design features, is concerned both with the pre-publication phase, in the study ofwhich one needs todistinguish the intentions of authors from those of publishers, and with the responses of readers. Tanselle pro poses three interrelated approaches to this complex area: the psychological, which considers the physiology of reading and the largely subconscious effectsproduced by features such as type styles and margin widths; the cultural, which analyses broad trends in book design and its connotations in the context of period styles; and the aesthetic, which relates book design to the intended and received meanings of specific texts. Work on literarymateriality, Tanselle suggests, has tended to con centrate on illustration, layout, and typographic displays, and to give insufficient consideration tobackground features such as typeface designs and tobindings. The volume concludes with a comprehensive bibliographical subject guide. Those new to bibliographical analysis will find this an accessible introduction to the history of the topic.

What causes problems in Alzheimer's disease: attributions by caregivers. A qualitative study,2004,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.1118,83,"Abstract Objective To gain insight into caregivers' understanding of the causes of behaviours they find problematic in people with Alzheimer's disease in order to inform the development of educational strategies. Methods A qualitative, semi‐structured interview was used. Participants were 205 caregivers for a person with Alzheimer's disease, all of whom were aware of the diagnosis and who had been recruited as part of a larger longitudinal study. Participants were from inner‐city and suburban London/semi‐rural Essex. The main outcome measures were caregivers' understanding of: the cause of problematic behaviour; the ability of the person with dementia to control this behaviour; the prognosis of the illness. Results Most carers attribute the cognitive, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia to causes other than dementia; many believe that the person with dementia has control over their behaviour and substantial numbers believe the person with dementia will return to normal. Conclusions This study suggests that providing facts about the illness to caregivers is not enough, as caregivers may not understand that the symptoms they observe are related to the diagnosis. Education by clinicians should focus on the understanding of caregivers and in particular explore the caregivers' attributions of the symptoms which are present in the person for whom they care.

The centrality of authorship in literary studies has been under attack for the last few decades. Yet Digital Humanities methods such as computational authorship attribution or “stylometry” seem to herald a rebirth of the author as a key interpretative category and can give rise to fears of a corresponding death of the reader, substituted by the machine. 

This paper will present a critical interrogation of the use of Digital Humanities methods to study Romantic periodical authorship. It presents a case study based upon the project A Question of Style: individual voices and corporate identity in the Edinburgh Review, 1814-20, funded by a Research Society for Victorian Periodicals Field Development grant. 

We assess the claim that nineteenth-century periodicals succeeded in creating, through a “transauthorial discourse” (Klancher 1987), a unified corporate voice that hid individual authors behind an impersonal public text. This paper will examine the following questions: 

Can we “operationalise” (Moretti 2013) the practice of authorship in the Edinburgh Review, selecting textual features that can be measured empirically with methods such as stylometry, corpus stylistics and Natural Language Processing? 

Which aspects of authorship are brought into focus through such a computational analysis of periodical literature? Which are instead elided, and must be recovered through other methods, such as close reading and archival research? 

Finally, can we successfully combine computational methods and literary interpretation in “algorithmic criticism” (Ramsay 2011)? Do these “distant reading” methods represent an improvement, a complement or a distortion of research into Romantic periodicals and their practices?","['Stylometry', 'Reading (process)', 'Interpretation (philosophy)', 'Romance', 'Criticism', 'Scrutiny', 'Writing style', 'Literary criticism', 'Identity (music)', 'Digital humanities', 'Literature', 'Sociology', 'Epistemology', 'History', 'Computer science', 'Linguistics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Aesthetics', 'Law', 'Political science', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Library science']","['Francesca Benatti', 'David King']",0,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Effects of Causal Attributions Following Mathematics Tasks on Student Cognitions About a Subsequent Task,2004,https://doi.org/10.3200/jexe.72.4.307-328,20,"The authors investigated the effects of former learning experiences on how students adapt to challenging mathematics tasks. A distinction has been made between domain-specific variables (goal orientation, self-concept of mathematics ability) and task- (or context-) specific appraisals (estimated competence for, attractiveness and relevance of the task). A model has been developed to explain how motivational variables interact in determining students' adaptive behavior when confronted with a learning task. In this study, the authors examined the adequacy of this model. The main question was whether this model needs to be extended by including causal attributions following mathematics tasks. To answer this question, the authors conducted 2 series of analyses. First, they investigated how causal attributions depend on domain- and task-specific variables. Second, they examined whether attributions of task outcome add to the explained variance in task-specific appraisals on a subsequent task confrontation. The findings show that when students attributed a good performance to their personal ability, a positive effect on their estimated competence in a subsequent task confrontation resulted. However, attribution of a poor performance to lack of effort had a negative impact on students' estimated competence. Consequences for modelling adaptive processes are discussed.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Competence (human resources)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Attractiveness', 'Social psychology', 'Cognition', 'Task (project management)', 'Domain specificity', 'Developmental psychology', 'Management', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Economics']","['Gerard Seegers', 'Cornelis M. van Putten', 'J.

However, these studies have primarily been conducted in Western cultures. The current study, conducted in China, examined the spontaneous causal attributions made by 54 relatives of schizophrenia patients during the Camberwell Family Interview. Chinese relatives made few controllable and personal attributions overall. Yet as predicted, highly critical and/or hostile EE relatives attributed patients' negative behaviors to more controllable and personal factors. High EE and controllable attributions positively predicted relapse, whereas personal attributions unexpectedly protected against relapse. EE mediated the effect of controllable, but not personal, attributions on relapse. Relatives' use of a particular Chinese characteristic (narrow-mindedness) was integral to the personal dimension's protective effect.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Expressed emotion', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Lawrence H.

Problems of Attribution of the Poetic Dramatic Vignette Atwieczerek,2021,https://doi.org/10.17951/sb.2021.15.155-171,0,"This article analyses the problem of attribution of the theatre vignette Evening: An Occasion in aTavern near Falkovičy based on well-known and more obscure publications. The hypothesis about H. Marcinkievič being the author of this play originally belongs to R.Ziamkievič. Although he did not have concrete proof of said authorship (the section titles of the play were wrongly indicated), he was earnest in sharing his hypothesis, as he informed F. Aliachnovič and A. Šlubski. M. Pijatuchovič, on the other hand, had adifferent outlook on the authorship of Evening.... In all fairness, he does not address the question of authorship at all in the prologue to his planned publications of A. Rypinski’s manuscripts, but it is likely that he mentioned during his lectures with Belarusian State University Students that the vignette was written by A. Viaryha-Dareŭski (we say this on the basis of later articles by A. Adamovič). M. Larčanka and L. Fihłoŭskaja, apparently lacking knowledge on A. Rypinski’s manuscripts, found the vignette in „Leningrad archives and libraries,” listed as written by Sazanovič. It is interesting that researchers have described the subject of the play in quite ageneral manner, as „the daily life of peasants under lordship,” which corresponds with the illustration of the text in the manuscripts of A. Rypinski. After the publication of Evening... in 1988, most researchers (V.Rahojša, H. Kisialioŭ, U. Marchel) have positioned themselves in favour of H. Marcinkievič’s authorship, even though V. Skałaban did propose not to rush to any final conclusions. The analysis of philological publications, the style of Polish-language works by H. Marcinkievič, as well as certain circumstances of literary life in Viciebsk between the end of the 1850s and the beginning of the 1860s allow us to voice some doubts about H.

Participants were asked to recall eight positive and eight negative cued autobiographical memories, and then generate a short attributional statement giving the reason why they thought each event had happened. They then rated the likelihood of each event happening in the future. Each attribution was coded along three attributional dimensions: Internality, Stability, and Globality and ratings were combined to yield a composite score for positive items and a composite score for negative items. Relative to controls, dysphorics gave more internal, stable and global attributions for negative events, but their attributions for positive events were more external, unstable and specific. The dysphoric group also showed greater pessimism for future events. Irrespective of mood state, when recalled past events were attributed to internal, stable and global causes, participants gave greater likelihood expectations, compared to when events were attributed to external, unstable and specific causes. It was concluded that attributions do play a part in the link between memory retrieval and future judgements. The explanations people give of their past experiences are important in influencing their perceptions of the likelihood of such experiences in the future.

BinComp: A stratified approach to compiler provenance Attribution,2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2015.05.015,49,"Compiler provenance encompasses numerous pieces of information, such as the compiler family, compiler version, optimization level, and compiler-related functions. The extraction of such information is imperative for various binary analysis applications, such as function fingerprinting, clone detection, and authorship attribution. It is thus important to develop an efficient and automated approach for extracting compiler provenance. In this study, we present B i n C o m p , a practical approach which, analyzes the syntax, structure, and semantics of disassembled functions to extract compiler provenance. B i n C o m p has a stratified architecture with three layers. The first layer applies a supervised compilation process to a set of known programs to model the default code transformation of compilers. The second layer employs an intersection process that disassembles functions across compiled binaries to extract statistical features (e.g., numerical values) from common compiler/linker-inserted functions. This layer labels the compiler-related functions. The third layer extracts semantic features from the labeled compiler-related functions to identify the compiler version and the optimization level. Our experimental results demonstrate that B i n C o m p is efficient in terms of both computational resources and time.","['Compiler', 'Computer science', 'Compiler correctness', 'Compiler construction', 'Optimizing compiler', 'Interprocedural optimization', 'Programming language', 'Loop optimization', 'Semantics (computer science)']","['Ashkan Rahimian', 'Paria Shirani', 'Saed Alrbaee', 'Lingyu Wang', 'Mourad Debbabi']",22,True,Digital Investigation,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Results indicated that interview rules could be categorized into two groups: specific interview presentation skills and general interpersonal competence. While situational attributions were more salient in explaining the breaking of general interpersonal competence rules, internal attributions (ability, effort) were more salient explanations for the breaking of more specific interview rules (with the exception of the preparation rule where lack of effort was the most likely explanation for rule breaking).

THE TRUTH-DECEPTION ATTRIBUTION: EFFECTS OF FAMILIARITY ON THE ABILITY OF OBSERVERS TO DETECT DECEPTION,1980,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1980.tb00130.x,101,"This study investigated the relationship between an observer's familiarity with the normal, truthful communicative behavior of an individual, and the observer's ability to detect deception on the part of that individual. Specifically, an attempt was made to provide an experimental test of the degree of linearity between familiarity and judgmental accuracy in detecting deception. After exposure to varying amounts of a communicator's normal, truthful behavior (baseline segment), observers made judgments of a communicator's veracity following observation of truthful or lying behavior (test segment). The results indicate a significant deviation from linearity in the relationship between familiarity and judgmental accuracy, and that the relationship is better described by an inverted parabolic curve (quadratic function). The possibility of information overload, the possibility of communicator-specific characteristics which provide clues to deception, and the possibility of observer fatigue were proposed as possible explanations of these results.","['Deception', 'Psychology', 'Observer (physics)', 'Lying', 'Social psychology', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Radiology', 'Medicine', 'Paleontology', 'Physics']","['David Brandt', 'Gerald R.

We examined the effects of independently manipulating f0 and speech rate on judgments of several state variables and personality traits. Male speakers answered interview questions and were randomly assigned to one of nine cells—three pitch (low/unmanipulated/high) by three rate (slow/unmanipulated/fast). Speech material was analyzed using linear predictive coding. Pitch was scaled up or down by 20% of the original f0, whereas rate was expanded or compressed by 30%. Resynthesized utterances were rated by listeners on a number of scales. High-pitched or slow-talking speakers seem particularly undesirable; high-pitched speakers were judged as less truthful, weaker, and nervous and slow talkers were judged as less truthful and passive. An utterance's content, presumably mediated by the question topic, also influenced state and trait attributions.","['Utterance', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Trait', 'Personality', 'Speech recognition', 'Linguistics', 'Acoustics', 'Computer science', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Philosophy', 'Programming language']","['Lynn A.

In this investigation, we are interested in the problem of class imbalance in Authorship Attribution (AA) task, with specific application on Arabic text data. This article proposes a new hybrid approach based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which considerably improve the performances of authorship attribution on imbalanced data. The used dataset contains 7 Arabic books written by 7 different scholars, which are segmented into text segments of the same size, with an average length of 2900 words per text. The obtained results of our experiments show that the proposed approach using the SMO-SVM classifier, presents high performance in terms of authorship attribution accuracy (100%), especially with starting character-bigrams.

Blame Attribution Styles and Rape Myth Acceptance in Male Child and Adult Sex Offenders,2020,,0,"This study investigates the cognition of sex offenders in their interpretation and making sense of convicted crimes and how they perceived themselves as contributors to the crime in their self-to-self-reflection perspective. The study was also designed to access their interpretation of other people’s attitude regarding rape. Three hundred and eighty-four incarcerated Thai sex offenders from eight Central Prisons across Thailand were examined for their cognitive processing in their committed crimes against child and adult victims using two self-report instruments: (1) Gudjonsson Blame Attribution Inventory-Revised (GBAI-R: Gudjonssan & Singh, 1989); and (2) Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance-Short Form (IRMA-SF: Payne, Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1999) which is used to examine their attitude toward the appropriateness regarding sexual intercourse also shaped by the general perception from society that they are embedded in. The impact of these contributing factors in nurturing the rape-supportive attitudes and beliefs are hypothesized to be reflected in their styles of blame attribution. Adult sex offenders reported a higher external attribution score than child sex offenders. There are no differences in the mental attribution and guilt scores between child sex offender and adult sex offender groups. Rape myth acceptance total mean score is positively correlated with the external attribution score in both child sex offender and adult sex offenders while the rape myth subscales reveal a different correlation to the blame attribution subscales. Rape myth acceptance statements and external blame attribution functioned to reduce guilt in adult sex offenders while it did not reduce guilt in child sex offenders but rather provided the content in their statements in justifying their criminal action to external and mental factors. There was no difference between child sex offenders and adult sex offender groups in the rape myth total mean score and seven rape myth subscales, which could","['Blame', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Sex offense', 'Sexual abuse', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Poison control', 'Suicide prevention', 'Medicine', 'Environmental health']",['Siriporn Pipatshukiat'],10,False,Thammasat Review,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

An application of attribution principles to nonverbal behavior in romantic dyads,1990,https://doi.org/10.1080/03637759009376189,48,"This article suggests ways in which attribution theories can explain the interpretation processes involved in understanding nonverbal behavior. An experiment examined attribution choices for nonverbal messages between romantic partners. Couples (N = 63) were videotaped while playing a game of “Trivial Pursuit.” During the interaction, one member of the dyad manipulated his or her nonverbal behaviors to appear positive at one point and negative at a second time period. If noticed, the partner made attributions for these behaviors. It was found that level of relational satisfaction correlated with perceptions of cause for nonverbal messages. In particular, negative behaviors were seen to be more intentional, stable, and controllable, whereas positive cues were perceived to be more external, unstable, and specific as relational satisfaction decreased. Further, satisfied couples were more likely to offer neutral motives for the negative behaviors of their partners. Overall, negative behaviors more commonly elicited overt attributions than did positive or baseline cues, but the number of attributions provided to account for the behaviors increased along with satisfaction level.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Nonverbal communication', 'Dyad', 'Social psychology', 'Perception', 'Romance', 'Developmental psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychoanalysis']",['Valerie Manusov'],75,False,Communication Monographs,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Le style attributionnel chez les enfants de six ans et ses liens avec les symptômes psychopathologiques,2018,,0,"Le style attributionnel est un des elements centraux de la recherche sur le developpement de la depression. Les theories cognitives de la depression proposent qu'un certain style attributionnel constitue un facteur cognitif de vulnerabilite qui, en combinaison avec des evenements de vie negatifs, peut predire une augmentation des symptomes depressifs (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989; Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978). Une personne ayant un style explicatif pessimiste aurait tendance a percevoir les causes des situations negatives comme etant internes, permanentes et globales et celles des situations positives comme etant externes, occasionnelles et specifiques. La facon habituelle de calculer le score du style attributionnel consiste a additionner le score des trois dimensions du style attributionnel (lieu de causalite, stabilite et globalite) de maniere a obtenir un score composite pour chaque type de situation. Les theories cognitives de la depression ont ete elaborees pour les adultes et ont ensuite ete transposees a peu pres telles quelles aux enfants sans adaptation a leur niveau de developpement et surtout, sans valider si les trois dimensions du style attributionnel etaient suffisamment correlees pour etre additionnees en score composite.

The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating role of hostility attribution bias (HAB) and the moderating role of rumination tendency in the relationship between peer victimization and revenge. The data were collected from 6,622 adolescents. The PROCESS macro of SPSS 26.0 was used to examine the hypotheses. The results show that peer victimization positively associates with revenge. Hostile attribution bias play a partial mediating role between peer victimization and revenge. Both the direct effect of peer victimization on revenge and the first half of the mediating effect of HAB are moderated by rumination tendencies. Specifically, both direct and indirect effects of peer victimization on revenge are stronger in individuals with concrete experiential rumination (CER) tendency than in those with abstract analytic rumination (AAR) tendency.","['Rumination', 'Psychology', 'Peer victimization', 'Hostility', 'Attribution bias', 'Attribution', 'Social psychology', 'Association (psychology)', 'Aggression', 'Developmental psychology', 'Human factors and ergonomics', 'Poison control', 'Cognition', 'Medicine', 'Environmental health', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychotherapist']","['Xuyan Zhao', 'Shujie Zheng']",41,True,Frontiers in Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
The Creation of Mary Adams (?): Questioning the Attribution of An Honorable Surrender,2016,https://doi.org/10.1353/cea.2016.0029,0,"The Creation of Mary Adams (?):Questioning the Attribution of An Honorable Surrender Jennifer A. Gehrman (bio) Elizabeth Stuart Phelps (1844–911), best known in our time as the author of The Story of Avis (1877), was an extremely prolific writer. Now, perhaps, it is time to add one more work to her extensive canon. Ever since Mary Angela Bennett published the first book-length biography of Phelps in 1939, scholars have generally agreed that Confessions of a Wife (1902), published by the Century Company under the name Mary Adams, was actually authored by Phelps. Writing twenty-eight years after Phelps’ death, Bennett claimed that “the style is unmistakably hers and the sentiment” (93). In 1982, Carol Farley Kessler concurred with Bennett, explaining that Phelps had constructed the pseudonym Mary Adams for herself by combining “the Christian name her mother had given her” with “her paternal grandmother’s family name” (108). Although Phelps’ authorship of Confessions of a Wife has been widely accepted, no other works Phelps might have published under this pseudonym have been brought to light. However, I would like to propose that there may be another. In 1883, nineteen years before the publication of Confessions of a Wife, another novel appeared under the name of Mary Adams, An Honorable Surrender, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons. I can find no irrefutable, external proof of Phelps’ authorship of this novel; however, to paraphrase Bennett, both the “style” and “sentiment” of this novel seem “unmistakably” similar to hers. The ability to establish definitive authorship of An Honorable Surrender has eluded attribution experts for decades. In the National Union Catalog (NUC), the novel is cross-listed under both Phelps and the name Mary Adams. A cataloger’s note in the authorities file at the Library of Congress indicates that attribution of this novel to Phelps was reported by Yale University, probably in 1905. However, the same catalog card indicates that Yale retr","['Pseudonym', 'Surrender', 'Wife', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Psychoanalysis', 'History', 'Law', 'Art', 'Psychology', 'Theology', 'Political science']",['Jennifer A.

They occur in specific contexts, of which reference to course reading is peculiar to novice writing. Comparisons with expert corpora in Norwegian and English indicate that some, but not all, of the differences between the novice corpora may be linked to influence from the learners’ first language and culture.","['Attribution', 'Acknowledgement', 'Norwegian', 'Linguistics', 'Authorship attribution', 'Reading (process)', 'Psychology', 'Rank (graph theory)', 'Computer science', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Computer security', 'Combinatorics']",['Hilde Hasselgård'],41,False,English Text Construction,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Negative Attributions as a Source of Vulnerability for trauma-related Shame and PTSD Symptoms,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-022-00481-z,0,"Abstract Shame is a common trauma response that is associated with the development and maintenance of PTSD. Phenomenological descriptions of shame indicate that shame arises from internal, stable and global causal attributions (negative attributions) for the precipitating event. The current study investigated whether negative attributions would be associated with higher levels of shame and PTSD, and whether shame would mediate the relationship between causal attributions and PTSD. As negative attributions may reflect a common transdiagnostic process in both depression and PTSD, it also examined whether depression would moderate this relationship. Eighty-seven participants meeting criteria for a Criterion A stressor were administered a structured PTSD diagnostic interview and a series of self-report measures. Findings indicate that shame mediated the relationship between internal, stable and global trauma-related causal attributions and PTSD symptoms. Further, depression did not moderate this relationship, indicating that negative causal attributions are associated with shame and PTSD independent of depression. Results provide empirical support for the cognitive concomitants of trauma-related shame, which raise the possibility that addressing negative attributions through cognitive therapeutic methods may be pertinent in reducing trauma-related shame. Future prospective data is needed to establish cognitive antecedents to shame.","['Shame', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognition', 'Stressor', 'Causality (physics)', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Rebecca Seah', 'David Berle']",57,True,Journal of Rational-Emotive & Cognitive-Behavior Therapy,['University of Technology Sydney'],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Specifically, I suggest that individuals' responses to negative outcomes at work can be better understood by differentiating between two types of external attributional explanations: external relational attributions and external nonrelational attributions. This research focuses on the conceptual development of external relational attributions, which are defined as those attributional explanations made for outcomes or behaviors experienced or observed by a focal individual that locate the cause of an outcome within the relationship between two others (people, groups, organizations, or any combination), not including the focal individual. Further, I propose situational antecedents and behavioral outcomes of external relational attributions, with an emphasis on individuals' behaviors toward others' relationships.

Multi-objective Feature Attribution Explanation For Explainable Machine Learning,2023,https://doi.org/10.1145/3617380,6,"The feature attribution-based explanation (FAE) methods, which indicate how much each input feature contributes to the model’s output for a given data point, are one of the most popular categories of explainable machine learning techniques. Although various metrics have been proposed to evaluate the explanation quality, no single metric could capture different aspects of the explanations. Different conclusions might be drawn using different metrics. Moreover, during the processes of generating explanations, existing FAE methods either do not consider any evaluation metric or only consider the faithfulness of the explanation, failing to consider multiple metrics simultaneously. To address this issue, we formulate the problem of creating FAE explainable models as a multi-objective learning problem that considers multiple explanation quality metrics simultaneously. We first reveal conflicts between various explanation quality metrics, including faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. Then, we define the considered multi-objective explanation problem and propose a multi-objective feature attribution explanation (MOFAE) framework to address this newly defined problem. Subsequently, we instantiate the framework by simultaneously considering the explanation’s faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. Experimental results comparing with six state-of-the-art FAE methods on eight datasets demonstrate that our method can optimize multiple conflicting metrics simultaneously and can provide explanations with higher faithfulness, lower sensitivity, and lower complexity than the compared methods. Moreover, the results have shown that our method has better diversity, i.e., it provides various explanations that achieve different tradeoffs between multiple conflicting explanation quality metrics. Therefore, it can provide tailored explanations to different stakeholders based on their specific requirements.","['Metric (unit)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Sensitivity (control systems)', 'Quality (philosophy)', 'Point (geometry)', 'Mathematics', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Operations management', 'Geometry', 'Epistemology', 'Electronic engineering', 'Engineering', 'Economics']","['Ziming Wang', 'Changwu Huang', 'Yun Li', 'Xin Yao']",66,True,ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization,['National Natural Science Foundation of China'],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The proposed framework draws on multiple conceptual approaches including models of attribution, group dynamics and stress responses to provide a detailed hypothetical description of athletes’ physiological, cognitive and affective responses to group competition. In describing this model we outline important antecedents of team attributions before hypothesising how attributions can impact hormonal and cardiovascular responses of athletes, together with cognitive (goals, choices, expectations), affective (self-esteem, emotions) and behavioural (approach–avoidance actions) responses of groups and group members. We conclude by outlining important methodological considerations and implications for structured context-specific attribution-based interventions.

The Mediating Role of Cognitive Reattribution and Reappraisal in the Esteem Support Process,2012,https://doi.org/10.1177/0093650212449015,29,"The recently proposed cognitive-emotional theory of esteem support messages (CETESM) posits that sophisticated esteem support messages enhance state self-esteem by promoting cognitive reattribution and reappraisal of esteem-threatening situations and their effects on the self. To test this hypothesis, participants ( N = 234) read a hypothetical situation in which they imagined they had experienced one of two esteem-threatening situations. They then read a conversation in which a helper offered high- or low-quality esteem support messages. Finally, participants completed measures of cognitive reattribution and reappraisal and state self-esteem. Results mostly supported the predicted mediational model, though one message feature failed to predict message ratings, and issues arose in assessing cognitive reattribution.","['Self-esteem', 'Psychology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive reappraisal', 'Conversation', 'Test (biology)', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Communication', 'Paleontology', 'Neuroscience', 'Biology']","['Amanda J.

Generality of the relationship between attributions and depression across attributional dimensions and across samples,1988,https://doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.47042,0,"Two hypotheses implicit in the use of composite measures of attributions in tests of learned helplessness theory (but not implicit in the theory itself) were tested: the hypotheses that relationships between depression and the three types of attributions are equal in magnitude, and linear. To test these hypotheses, data from three published studies of the reformulated learned helplessness theory of depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) were reanalyzed. The hypothesis that internal, stable, and global attributions are equally related to depression was tested and rejected. Increases in internal attributions were related to depression in one sample: increases in global attributions for negative events were related to depression in two samples: stability attributions for negative events were unrelated to depression. The relationship between attributions and depression was nonlinear .in one of the three populations studied. Finally, a third hypothesis was tested: the hypothesis that the relationship between attributions and depression is equal across samples. The hypothesis was rejected: attributions for negative events were more highly related to depression in a psychiatric sample than in normal populations.

Validation of the Attributional-Style Academic Questionnaire for evaluation in the admission to higher education,2021,https://doi.org/10.32870/dse.vi23.937,0,"Universities seek to characterize their students to prevent them from dropping out of school and facilitate completion of their studies. Among the variables diagnosed and related to students’ performance, success and school career are cognitive-motivational variables: self-esteem, self-concept, and motivation (Pool-Cibrian & Martinez-Guerrero, 2013). These are built upon another variable: the attributional style, or how to define how students interpret what happens to them; that is, the way in which a student interprets the good and the bad things that happen to them in school or in relation to their learning (Petri and Govern, 2015).
The aim of this study was to adapt the Academic Attributional Style Questionnaire (CEAA) in a sample of pre-university students. The instrument was adapted and applied to applicants to enroll in a university of Mexico City. The results show that the questionnaire items were organized into four factors, coinciding with Peterson et al.’s (1982) proposal, the empirical foundation of the instrument.

The Leader-in-Social-Network Schema: Perceptions of Network Structure Affect Gendered Attributions of Charisma,2015,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2015.0965,74,"Charisma is crucially important for a range of leadership outcomes. Charisma is also in the eye of the beholder—an attribute perceived by followers. Traditional leadership theory has tended to assume charismatic attributions flow to men rather than women. We challenge this assumption of an inevitable charismatic bias toward men leaders. We propose that gender-biased attributions about the charismatic leadership of men and women are facilitated by the operation of a leader-in-social-network schema. Attributions of charismatic leadership depend on the match between the gender of the leader and the perceived structure of the network. In three studies encompassing both experimental and survey data, we show that when team advice networks are perceived to be centralized around one or a few individuals, women leaders are seen as less charismatic than men leaders. However, when networks are perceived to be cohesive (many connections among individuals), it is men who suffer a charismatic leadership disadvantage relative to women. Perceptions of leadership depend not only on whether the leader is a man or a woman but also on the social network context in which the leader is embedded.","['Charisma', 'Social psychology', 'Charismatic authority', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Perception', 'Schema (genetic algorithms)', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Political science', 'Computer science', 'Communication', 'Neuroscience', 'Machine learning', 'Law']","['Raina A.

A thematic analysis of attributions to others for the origins and ongoing nature of pain in community pain sufferers,2008,https://doi.org/10.1080/13548500701842966,17,"Research suggests that pain sufferers can attribute their pain to others. However, this work is scarce, lacking in detail and does not focus on any particular time during the pain experience. To understand how these attributions operate in pain, this study sought to examine as an exclusive focus the types, context of, and rationale for attributions made to others for the origins and ongoing nature of pain. A community pain sample was voluntarily recruited into the study to gain a comprehensive understanding of these attributions and minimise potential group-specific bias. Sixty-two participants were interviewed using semi-structured questions about cause, responsibility and blame for pain. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis. Attributions to others emerged across interview questions. Acquaintances, professionals and strangers were implicated in pain onset for reasons including negligence, accident and attack. Few additional attributions were made for pain now. Those made were mostly to medical professionals for perceived poor treatment of an original pain condition encompassing issues related to compliance, diagnosis and treatment and searching for alternative pain solutions. This research provides insight into the social context in which pain attributions to others are reported, and provides the basis for research into largely untapped areas including the implications particular attributions have for adjustment to pain and relationships with others.","['Attribution', 'Blame', 'Thematic analysis', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Psychology', 'Pain and suffering', 'Pain catastrophizing', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Chronic pain', 'Qualitative research', 'Psychiatry', 'Sociology', 'Social science', 'Paleontology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Biology']","['Joanna McParland', 'Anne Whyte']",36,False,Psychology Health & Medicine,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Younger and middle-aged adults were more relativistic in their causal attributions than older adults. Relative proportions of dispositional justifications correlated with quantitative dispositional ratings, but only for relationship situations (suggesting strong domain-specific influences on attributional judgments). Clusters of individuals differing in patterns of attributional justifications were identified. Cluster groups showed salient differences in dispositional ratings and dialectical reasoning.

In contrast, atheists agreed less with brief aphorisms when they were presented as Bible verses (Studies 1 and 2), whereas Christians agreed more (Study 2). Democrats and Republicans (USA) and Labour supporters and Conservative supporters (UK) agreed more with politically non-divisive aphorisms that were presented as originating from a politician belonging to their own party (e.g., Clinton, Trump, Corbyn) than with the same aphorisms when they were presented as originating from a politician belonging to the rival party (Studies 3 and 4). This source attribution effect was not moderated by education, amount of thinking about the aphorisms, identification with the ingroup, trust, dissonance, fear of reproach, or attitude strength.

The Denigration of Heroes? How the Status Attainment Process Shapes Attributions of Considerateness and Authenticity,2014,https://doi.org/10.1086/678304,97,"This article develops and tests a theory to explain the common tendency to ""denigrate heroes,"" whereby high-status actors are suspected of being inconsiderate and inauthentic relative to low-status counterparts. This tendency is argued to reflect two conditions typical of status attainment processes: (a) assertions of superiority over others and (b) the presence of incentives to pursue status. The latter is key since awareness of such incentives breeds suspicions of inauthenticity, which in turn undermine perceptions of prosocial intentions. This theory is validated in a series of online experiments, in which categorical status hierarchies emerge either via deference on a coordinated task or via competitive interactions. Results show that high-status actors may also be ""celebrated"" as authentic and considerate when the observable incentive structure is such that assertions of superiority appear as unintended by-products of prosocial action. Implications are drawn regarding the sources of instability and insecurity in status hierarchies.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Status attainment', 'Social psychology', 'Process (computing)', 'Sociology', 'Demography', 'Socioeconomic status', 'Computer science', 'Operating system', 'Population']","['Oliver Hahl', 'Ezra W.

"""Initiators of Discursive Practices"": Authorship, Attribution, and Intent in the Debates between &lt;i&gt;Philosophes&lt;/i&gt; and Anti-&lt;i&gt;philosophes&lt;/i&gt; (1760)",2012,https://doi.org/10.1353/frf.2012.0047,0,"""Initiators of Discursive Practices"":Authorship, Attribution, and Intent in the Debates between Philosophes and Anti-philosophes (1760)1 Logan J. Connors In his seminal work, L'œil vivant, Jean Starobinski theorizes on how pseudonymity—the false attribution of authorship—affects a reader. He writes: ""Lorsqu'un homme se masque ou se revêt d'un pseudonyme, nous nous sentons défiés. Cet homme se refuse à nous. Et en revanche nous voulons savoir.""2 It is probable that Starobinski, a master at looking at the pourquoi behind writers (in this case, he is examining Stendhal), meant ""readers"" by ""nous"" in ""nous nous sentons defiés"" and ""the author's name"" by the word ""savoir"" in ""nous voulons savoir."" Starobinski gestures towards a type of miscommunication between the author's intent and the reader's desires. Specific miscommunications between readers and writers, as I see it, provide intriguing contexts to examine more general problems in literary criticism and its history. What follows is an attempt to show the unintended magnitude of Starobinski's comment on pseudonymity both in the specific context of Voltaire's 1760 staging of the play, Le café ou l'Écossaise, and in larger debates in the emerging fields of anonymity, pseudonymity, and attribution studies. Voltaire's use of multiple pseudonyms before and after releasing L'Ecossaise, a comédie sérieuse in which Voltaire attacks his enemy Elie-Cathérine Fréron, supports his philosophe friends at a crucial moment in history, and exemplifies his taste for serious comedy and British drama calls into question traditional takes on pseudonymity, anonymity, and attribution by refusing to fit into the binary arguments of anonymous vs. attributed, and authorial intent vs. the reader's control. As we shall see, a network of competing interests beyond Voltaire's sought to control, manipulate, and even initiate a host of discourses about the play.

Specifically, in a prospective study of stress and well-being in adolescence, internal, stable, and global attributions for negative events attributed to uncontrollable causes were found to be positively related to increases in depression (as predicted by the reformulated helplessness theory), but internal and global attributions for negative events attributed to controllable causes were found to be inversely related to increases in depression.

Learning Stylometric Representations for Authorship Analysis,2017,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2017.2766189,90,"Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of authors from textual data. It extracts an author's identity and sociolinguistic characteristics based on the reflected writing styles in the text. The process is essential for various areas, such as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc. However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been shown to be scenario- or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for AA. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets.

Results: 1In this sample,the rate of students with suicidal ideation was 1. 1%. The attribution style possessed by college freshmen was inclined to internal attribution,as well as under the condition of interpersonal communication success and failure. 2The interpersonal attribution style was more tendency to extroversion in college freshmen with suicidal ideation than those without suicidal ideation. 3The interpersonal relationship attribution scores( IRAS) and extroversion attribution were positively correlated with the scores of suicidal ideation. The score of suicidal ideation was positively correlated with IRAS,background and ability under the condition of interpersonal communication success,but negatively correlated with endeavor score; while it was positively correlated IRAS,background,fortune and ability under the condition of failure. 4The factors related to suicidal ideation were background under the condition of interpersonal communication failure,interpersonal successful attribution,ability under the condition of success.

Agree-to-Disagree (A2D): A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Authorship Discrimination Task in Corpus-Specificity Free Manner,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3021658,2,"Authorship discrimination is the task of detecting whether two writings are authored by the same person. From literature study to forensic analysis, the authorship discrimination makes a significant contribution in differentiating authorship. In this work, we propose Agree-to-Disagree (A2D), a novel framework for the authorship discrimination task. It is a two-stage deep learning-based framework consisting of an `Agree' and a `Disagree' network. At the first stage, it learns the authorship attributes with its Agree network. Subsequently, through its Disagree network, the framework attempts to differentiate the authorship of a new dataset (completely unrelated to the training dataset), a novel use case that has not been systematically considered hitherto in the literature. We show that A2D is not dependent on the dataset-specific prior knowledge and it can learn only from authorship attributes of the dataset to detect whether two different writings are from the same author. We prove that the A2D framework can successfully reveal the authorship with pseudonyms through tasking it with unfolding the pseudonyms of a famous American short story writer Washington Irving. We also apply our framework on a historical topic of ascertaining whether the authorship of the most respected book in Islam (the Holy Quran) can be attributed to the Prophet of Islam. Through the experimental analysis, A2D reveals that the Prophet of Islam is not the author of the Holy Quran, and this result is in perfect alignment with the belief of 1.8 billion Muslims around the globe regarding the authorship of this holy book.","['Computer science', 'Task (project management)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Globe', 'Islam', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Stylometry', 'Natural language processing', 'Epistemology', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Archaeology', 'Neuroscience', 'Economics']","['Md.

Power Bases and Attribution in Three Cultures,2003,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224540309598451,25,"Abstract The authors used a Saudi context to verify the cross-cultural generality of findings (A. Rodrigues & K. L. Lloyd, 1998) reported for U.S. and Brazilian samples in which compliant behavior caused by reward, informational, and referent influences was perceived as more controllable and more internal than compliant behavior resulting from legitimate, expert, and coercive influences. This differential attribution led, in turn, to different affective and behavioral responses. In the present study, cognitive and affective reactions of Saudi students were measured with regard to compliant behavior (leading to a good outcome or a bad outcome) caused by each of the 6 bases of power described by B. H. Raven (1965). As expected, power bases had significant effects. However, when the outcome of the compliant behavior was bad, compliant behavior caused by a coercive influence led to the perception of more internality and controllability. Also—and not found in previous studies—the perception of less internality and controllability of compliant behavior was caused by an informational influence. Findings are discussed in the light of related research and Saudi cultural characteristics.","['Attribution', 'Power (physics)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics']","['Falah M.

A - 120 Fatigue Moderates the Relationship between Negative Attributional Style and Depression Symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis,2023,https://doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acad067.137,0,"Abstract Objective To investigate whether fatigue moderates the relationship between negative attributional style and depression symptoms in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). Method Forty-seven PwMS (39 Female) completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and psychosocial questionnaires. The Attributional Style Questionnaire was utilized to create internal, stable, and global attribution dimension scores, and an overall attributional style score combining the three dimensions. Overall, physical, psychosocial, and cognitive fatigue were measured using the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS). The Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen was used to measure depression symptoms. Separate regressions with depression symptoms as the outcome were conducted with attributional style, each type of fatigue, and their interactions included as predictors. Results Regression analyses revealed that the interaction between attributional style and overall fatigue significantly predicted depression symptoms (p = 0.049). Simple effects tests showed that overall attributional style significantly predicted depression symptoms when overall fatigue was high (p = 0.008). The interactions between attributional style and both physical fatigue (p = 0.003) and psychosocial fatigue (p = 0.039) also significantly predicted depression symptoms. Simple effects tests showed that attributional style was associated with depression symptoms only in PwMS with high physical fatigue (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and high psychosocial fatigue (p = 0.018). Conclusions Fatigue moderated the relationship between overall attributional style and depression symptoms in PwMS. Specifically, attributional style was only significantly associated with depression symptoms in PwMS reporting high levels of overall, physical, and psychosocial fatigue. Interventions aimed at targeting fatigue may reduce the risk that negative attributional style will lead to depressive symptoms in MS.","['Psychosocial', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychological intervention', 'Attribution bias', 'Beck Depression Inventory', 'Psychiatry', 'Cognition', 'Anxiety', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Alexa Verkuilen', 'Megan L Bradson', 'Peter A.

Using an abstract experiment and a survey of experienced financial managers, we provide evidence that managerial overconfidence may also contribute to this decision. Our experiment shows that participants engage in self‐serving attribution, giving greater weight to internal than external factors as explanations for good performance. This increases confidence in improved future performance, which increases their willingness to issue forecasts. Two facets of the stable individual trait overconfidence, dispositional optimism and miscalibration, also contribute to confidence in improved future performance and willingness to issue forecasts. Consistent with these results, experienced financial manager survey participants believe other managers are likely to overestimate the extent to which they contribute to positive firm performance, and both overoptimism about firm performance and overconfidence in their ability to predict future firm performance contribute to issuance of earnings forecasts.","['Overconfidence effect', 'Optimism', 'Earnings', 'Trait', 'Attribution', 'Actuarial science', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Economics', 'Accounting', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['Robert Libby', 'Kristina M.

ROLE OF PARENT’S ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP IN INCREASING SELF-ESTEEM OF CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA,2019,https://doi.org/10.35631/ijepc.4320028,0,"Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder due to difficulties in phonological processing that impacts on the fluency and reading comprehension ability. The aim of this research is to identify the role of parents’ attributional style and parent-child relationship in determining the level of self-esteem in children with dyslexia. There are 24 respondents who consist of the parent or the caregiver of children with dyslexia along with the child were invited to participate in this research. The method used in this research is a cross-sectional study design using a quantitative approach. The researcher used three different tests to measure the variables involved. Tests used in this research consist of Causal Dimensional Scale II, Parent-Child Relationship Inventory and Rosenberg’s Self Esteem Scale. Results showed there is a significant relationship between parents’ attributional style and level of self-esteem in children with dyslexia. Attributional style measured in this research consists of four dimensions namely, locus of causality, external control, stability, and personal control. However, only two of the dimensions mentioned above are significantly related to the level of self-esteem in children with dyslexia. The two dimensions are external control (r = 0.408, p &gt; 0.05) and personal control (r = 0.557, p &gt; 0.05). Whereas, results showed there is no significant relationship between the parent-child relationship and the level of self-esteem of children with dyslexia. In a nutshell, the role of parents’ attributional style in determining the level of self-esteem in children with dyslexia is notably significant while the relationship of parent-child does not influence the level of self-esteem in children with dyslexia.","['Psychology', 'Dyslexia', 'Developmental psychology', 'Locus of control', 'Fluency', 'Self-esteem', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Reading (process)', 'Mathematics education', 'Archaeology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'History']","['Hilwa Abdullah Mohd.

Alexander Perrig is a reductionist of the most extreme kind, reducing the number of Michelangelo's authentic drawings to 24, from the 785 of Hirst in 1988, the 630 of de Tolnay in 1975-80, the 465 of Hartt in 1971, and the ca. 250 accepted earlier in the century (figures from a review of Perrig by Martin Kemp, Times Literary Supplement, 8 November, 1991, p. 23). This rank growth, so ruthlessly pruned, is, he argues, the consequence of poor methodology by several generations of Michelangelo scholars amounting almost to a conspiracy to obscure the truth. Not surprisingly, his views have not been well received. The British Museum, with 15 drawings downgraded, is reported to have responded: 'We have no reason to revise our opinions of the drawings in our collection' (review of Perrig in The Economist, 27 July 1991, pp. 77-78). In Michael Hirst's Michelangelo and his drawings (1988) the only reference to the series of publications in German which form the basis of this book is to the earliest, which is dismissed as an example of 'the reattribution to other artists of drawings long held to be Michelangelo's own, without a serious attempt to enquire how the former actually drew' (p. 2). Others are no doubt murmuring that Perrig has no 'eye'. Is this a case of the art museum/art history establishment closing ranks againstradicalnew insights, or has Perrig failed to understand how Michelangelo drew?

In the paper, we approach this question with the new tool of authorship verification – one of the most promising approaches in forensic stylometry today – as well as the established method of principal components analysis to demonstrate that there is no simple alternative between single and multiple authorship, and that the results of a computational analysis are in fact compatible with the results obtained from historical, literary, and philological analysis.","['Stylometry', 'Philology', 'History', 'Simple (philosophy)', 'Principal (computer security)', 'Literature', 'Epistemology', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Linguistics', 'Law', 'Political science', 'Feminism', 'Operating system']","['Justin Stover', 'Mike Kestemont']",10,False,Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
A Study on the Relationship between College Students’ Boredom Tendency and Attribution Style as well as Achievement Motivation,2016,https://doi.org/10.5430/ijhe.v5n3p117,0,"Aim: This thesis discusses the relationship between college students’ boredom tendency and attribution style as well as achievement motivation. Method: The author uses scale assessment on college students of boredom tendency scale, the inner-control scale, internality-powerful others scale and chance scale draw up by Leveson, as well as achievement motivation scale. Results: 1) There is no significant differences in sex on the boredom tendency of college students; in grade level, a comparatively significant difference exists between the total scores of tension, binding force and boredom tendency. 2) The total score of boredom tendency has significant negative correlation with that of achievement motivation (r=-0.509, p&lt;0.01), has significant negative correlation with the success-wish dimension (r=-0.284, p&lt;0.05), has significant positive correlation with the failure-fear dimension (r=0.505, p&lt;0.01), has negative correlation with the inner-control dimension (r=-0.133, p&lt;0.05), has positive correlation with the chance dimension (r=0.406, p&lt;0.01), and has significant positive correlation with internality-powerful others dimension (r=0.373, p&lt;0.01). 3) The boredom tendency has mediating effect on achievement motivation and attribution style.

Four grade 7 (13 year old) classes, consisting of 40 poor readers and 56 average readers, participated in the study. Students were randomly allocated to one of four instruction conditions involving different combinations of strategy instruction and attributional training. Instruction was provided in small groups of 6 to 8 students over nine one‐hour sessions. Results indicated that teaching poor readers use of effective reading strategies, while convincing them that reading successes and failures were attributable to use of effective or ineffective strategies, not only improved their comprehension performance and increased use of reading strategies, but also reduced their perceptions of learned helplessness.","['Psychology', 'Reading (process)', 'Reading comprehension', 'Task (project management)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Comprehension', 'Perception', 'Control (management)', 'Mathematics education', 'Computer science', 'Linguistics', 'Neuroscience', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Paleontology', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Biology', 'Programming language']",['Lorna K.

These thinking-feeling-action linkages were applied to the domain of child maltreatment in the present study. In individual interviews, samples of abusive, at-risk, and nonabusive African American mothers were presented with videotaped scenarios depicting a target child engaged in misbehavior. Mothers rated the severity of the behavior, how responsible they perceived the child to be, their feelings of sympathy and anger, and how much punishment they would endorse, coded as mild to harsh. They also completed a measure of parental stress. Compared with nonabusive mothers, abusive mothers reported more stress, perceived the behavior as more negative, inferred the child to be more responsible, reported more anger, and endorsed harsher punishment. The attributional data of at-risk mothers consistently fell between that of the other two groups.

Expressed Emotion and Attributions in Relatives of Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Panic Disorder,2016,https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000000636,8,"Relatives' criticism of, hostility toward, and emotional overinvolvement (EOI) with patients are predictive of treatment response and relapse. Although these constructs have been linked to relatives' attributions for patient problems, little research has yet evaluated attributions for specific types of problems. This study examined event-specific attributions (i.e., attributions specifically for either disorder-related [DR] or non-DR problems) in relatives of patients with anxiety disorders. Relatives made more illness attributions (attributing problems to a patient's disorder) than controllable attributions (attributing problems to factors controllable by patients) for DR events, with the reverse pattern for non-DR events. Criticism and hostility were associated primarily with controllability attributions for non-DR events. In contrast, the presence of EOI was associated with illness attributions for non-DR events. Family-based interventions for anxiety disorders might need to focus on relatives' controllability attributions for a broad range of patient behaviors and on reducing tendencies to attribute non-DR problems to patients' disorders.","['Attribution', 'Hostility', 'Expressed emotion', 'Psychology', 'Panic disorder', 'Anxiety', 'Panic', 'Psychological intervention', 'Anxiety disorder', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology']","['Keith D.

Lateral asymmetry of emotional arousal as a biomarker of attributional style during darts competitions,2024,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42977-024-00225-3,0,"Abstract According to the Multiple Arousal Theory, electrodermal activity (EDA) is not uniform across the body. However, the psychological meaning of a left or right-sided EDA dominance is still not clear. We explored EDA lateral asymmetry as a psychophysiological marker of optimistic and pessimistic attributional style regarding success and failure in a darts competition. Bilateral EDA pattern of 230 throws of a competing pair was measured by Obimon EDA including accelerometer measurements of movements. First, we confirmed that lateral asymmetry can be measured reliably based on EDA data from both wrists. Second, we assessed attributional styles related to lateral asymmetry based on 80 individual throws. We recorded participants’ expectations regarding their upcoming performance, and their attribution of success and failure based on Seligman’s definition as optimist ( internal cause attributed to success, or external cause ascribed to failure) or pessimist . The ratio of optimist and pessimist attributions was significantly different for throws with right or left-sided EDA dominance ( p = 0.001). Optimistic attribution characterized 84% of right dominant, while pessimist 63% of left-dominant EDA during throws. We replicated these findings on 50 throws from 10 more individuals ( p = 0.034). All individuals were right-handed. We conclude that wrist EDA can be reliably measured during physical movements, such as in a darts game. Lateral EDA asymmetry is a consistent psychophysiological marker of the attitude toward success and failure in a competitive setting, suggesting that lateral asymmetry of emotional arousal may serve as a novel psychophysiological biomarker for attribution style. Results underlie the psychophysiological relevance of bilateral arousal assessment and provide evidence-based verification for the Multiple Arousal Theory.","['Pessimism', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Arousal', 'Dominance (genetics)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Biology', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Biochemistry', 'Archaeology', 'Epistemology', 'Gene']","['S.

Mood-Related Persuasion Depends on (Mis)Attributions,1994,https://doi.org/10.1521/soco.1994.12.4.309,221,"Previous research has shown that respondents in sad moods are likely to elaborate persuasive messages and to be highly persuaded by strong but not weak arguments. In contrast, respondents in happy moods are less likely to elaborate persuasive messages and hence show equal, moderate, persuasion by both strong and weak arguments. To examine how mood-related persuasion effects might be moderated by attributions concerning the source of a person's mood, students were approached on days with either pleasant or unpleasant weather and were asked to participate in a survey relating to higher education. Participants either were or were not cued to the weather as a source of their mood. They listened to either strong or weak arguments supporting the implementation of comprehensive examinations for graduating students. Attitudes toward comprehensive exams were measured. Participants reported more positive moods on pleasant days than on unpleasant days. When the weather was not made salient, weather (i.e., mood) interacted with argument strength: When weather was unpleasant, argument strength had an effect on attitudes, but when weather was pleasant, argument strength had no effect. In contrast, when participants were cued to the weather, there were no weather effects on persuasion; instead, attitudes were affected only by argument strength. Implications, mechanisms, and directions for future research are discussed.","['Persuasion', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Mood', 'Argument (complex analysis)', 'Social psychology', 'Cued speech', 'Contrast (vision)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science']","['Robert C.

Effect of educational intervention based on locus of control structure of attribution theory on self-care behavior of patients with type II diabetes,2017,https://doi.org/10.14196/mjiri.31.116,9,"Background: Different factors, such as personality and psychological characteristics, are effective in the self-care and control of diabetes. This study aimed at determining the effect of educational intervention based on locus of control structure of attribution theory on the self-care behavior of patients with type II diabetes. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental controlled study performed on 180 patients in Babol Diabetes Association. The sampling method was simple random sampling. Data collection tool was form C of standard questionnaire in multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC) and summary of diabetes self-care activities (SDSCA). Based on the results obtained from the initial completion of the questionnaires, educational intervention was designed as three 60-minute educational sessions using short lectures, question and answer, group discussions, and consultation methods, as well as educational materials, such as films, posters, and pamphlets. Intervention was only performed for the test group. The questionnaires were filled out again 2 and 3 months after the intervention. Results: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference in the mean scores of self-care, internal, chance, and external locus of control between the 2 groups. However, 2 to 3 months after the intervention, the mean scores of self-care (p<0.001) and locus of control (p<0.001) increased in the test group. Moreover, the mean score of chance (p<0.001) and external (p<0.001) locus of control decreased significantly. Conclusion: Educational intervention decreases the mean scores of chance and external locus of control and increases the mean score of internal locus of control; as a result, it improves self-care in patients with diabetes.","['Locus of control', 'Attribution', 'Type 2 diabetes', 'Personality', 'Medicine', 'Psychology', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Developmental psychology', 'Nursing', 'Social psychology', 'Endocrinology']","['Farbod Ebadi Fardazar', 'Hassan Heidari', 'Mahnaz Solhi']",39,True,Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Public responses to scientific research: Does disciplinary attribution matter?,2018,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662518814365,6,Research has shown that the form and content of science communications can influence individuals' responses. This study examines whether individuals' perceptions of scientific research are influenced by the discipline to which the research is attributed. Two vignette experiments find that neither the perceived scientific-ness nor trustworthiness of a study originating from sociology is affected by attributing the study to a different social science or to a natural or medical science. These null findings contrast with surveys showing sizable disciplinary differences in public attitudes. It is possible that disciplinary attribution is a less salient cognitive shortcut when presented in longer communications as compared to survey questions that only provide the name of a discipline.

The aim of the training was to level off the gender differences, which are repeatedly reported for this subject, especially for gifted students. The treatment consisted of the presentation of a 10.35 minute video whereby two students, who had already completed their chemistry courses, discuss the experiences they had encountered with the subject. Their exchange communicates, among other things, that success and failure in chemistry can be controlled and that anyone can be successful in this subject if he/she applies an adequate amount of effort to learning.

Further, conflict behaviour as function of attachment style, as well as gender was also examined. An online self-report survey was completed by adults in current romantic relationships (N = 352); which assessed participants’ attachment orientations, and attributions made (causal and responsibility), and behaviours used (attacking, avoidance and problem-solving) in response to couple conflict. Participants’ responses to the measures were based on a standardised vignette, which portrayed a hypothetical partner transgression. Accordingly, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were found to both positively predict causal attributions; attachment anxiety was found to be a positive predictor of responsibility attributions, though attachment avoidance was not. In addition, attachment anxiety was positively associated with attacking behaviours and attachment avoidance was positively associated with conflict avoidance; attachment anxiety was found to be positively associated with problem-solving, whilst attachment avoidance was not. No support was provided for any of the mediational models. Finally, no differences were found between attachment styles for any of the conflict behaviours, and no sex differences were found in the use of conflict behaviours. The findings have particular implications for future intervention and treatments focused on couple conflict, particularly in regards to the dynamics that guide conflict behaviours.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Attachment theory', 'Developmental psychology', 'Vignette', 'Anxiety', 'Social psychology', 'Romance', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychoanalysis']",['Hayleigh Dunne'],0,False,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

This ""neo-shamanic,"" and often recreational, use of ayahuasca, however, has to be distinguished from traditional Indigenous praxes on the one hand, and, on the other hand, from medical investigation in the modern world. The former, Indigenous use mainly understands ayahuasca as an amplifying power for interacting with non-human beings in the animal, plant, or spirit realms. Within this paradigm, efficacy is not dependent on the drug, but on the correct communication between the healer (or sorcerer) and the non-human powers that are considered real and powerful also without resorting to ayahuasca. The latter, modern mode of understanding, contrastingly treats the neurochemical processes of MAO inhibition and dimethyltryptamine activity as trigger mechanisms for a series of psychological as well as somatic responses, including positive outcomes in the treatment of various mental conditions. I argue that there is an ontological incommensurability occurring especially between the Indigenous and medicinal concepts of ayahuasca use (with recreational use in its widest understanding trying to make sense from both sides). Modern medical applications of ayahuasca are so fundamentally different from Indigenous concepts that the latter cannot be used to legitimate or confirm the former (and vice versa). Finally, the deep coloniality in the process of appropriation of the Indigenous by the modern has to be questioned and resolved in any case of ayahuasca application.","['Ayahuasca', 'Indigenous', 'Psychology', 'Shamanism', 'Appropriation', 'Environmental ethics', 'Popularity', 'Sociology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Epistemology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Anthropology', 'Ecology', 'Philosophy', 'Biology', 'Archaeology']",['Bernd Brabec de Mori'],29,True,Frontiers in Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

This paper considers the role of perceptual attribution in determining or guiding perceptual reference to objects. We consider three extant models of the relation between perceptual attribution and perceptual reference–all attribution guides reference, no attribution guides reference, or a privileged subset of attributions guides reference–and argue that empirical evidence undermines all three. We then defend a flexible‐attributives model , on which the range of perceptual attributives used to guide reference shifts adaptively with context. This model underscores the remarkable and dynamic intelligence of our perceptual capacities.

Attributions of Genre and Style in Piano Works by Ivan Karabyts,2023,https://doi.org/10.31500/2309-8813.19.2023.294903,0,"The piano works of the Ukrainian composer Ivan Karabyts (1945–2002) developed in the wake of the influential avant-garde trends of the second half of the twentieth century. In the style of his piano opuses of the 1960s and 1970s, we can trace the influence of various stylistic discourses of the twentieth century. This stylistic versatility is, on the one hand, a general reflection of the cultural and artistic innovations of the postwar period and, on the other, a manifestation of the trends of the Sixtiers movement, in particular, the Kyiv Avant-Garde, whose activities were shaped by the innovative compositional techniques of the time as a reflection of the avant-garde intentions. The paper aims to study the genre and style attributions of piano works by Ivan Karabyts. The tasks include an analysis of the composer’s style focusing on his piano works of the 1960s and 1970s: Sonata for piano (1964), diptych Prelude and Toccata (1965–1966) and 24 Preludes for piano (1976), intonation, thematic, genre and style of these opuses. The article raises the question of the influence of Borys Liatoshynsky on the piano concepts of Ivan Karabyts, both at the level of symphonism of the piano idea, which was initially tested in the field of instrumental compositions, and at the level of allusions to the works of Liatoshynsky himself in the 1920s in the genre of sonata and prelude. On the other hand, the example of the analyzed piano pieces shows the avant-garde principles of building a sonorous musical composition (atonality, diminished and enlarged intervals, septacords, claves, etc.). We should also mention the baroque principle, realized in the early diptych Toccata and Prelude, and the overall baroque direction of the composer’s work in large forms in his mature period. The pinnacle of the composer’s piano explorations is the 24 Preludes. Their musical language is original, complete with innovative stylistic trends.

The Relationship between attribution styles and attitude toward mathematics of mathematically gifted students and those of regular students at elementary schools,2010,,0,"The purpose of this study is to provide information that will help understand unique characteristics of mathematically gifted students and that can be utilized for special programs for mathematically gifted students, by investigating difference and relationship between attribution styles and attitude toward mathematics of mathematically gifted students and those of regular students. For that purpose, 202 mathematically gifted students and 415 regular students in 5th and 6th grades at elementary schools were surveyed in terms of attribution styles and attitude toward mathematics, and the result of the study is as follows. First, as for attribution styles, there was no difference between gifted students and regular students in terms of grade and gender, but there was significant difference in sub factors because of giftedness. Second, there was not significant difference between grades. but there was significant difference in sub factors between genders. Mathematically gifted students were more positive than regular students in every sub factor excepting gender role conformity, and especially they showed higher confidence and motivation. Third, according to the result of correlation analysis, there was significant static correlation between inner tendencies and attitude toward mathematics with both groups. The gifted group showed higher correlation between attribution of effort and attitude toward mathematics and inner tendencies and confidence than the regular group. The gifted group showed higher correlation in sub factors, and especially there was high static correlation between attribution of talent and confidence, and attribution of effort and motivation. Fourth, according to the result of multiple regression analysis, inner tendencies showed significant relation to attitude toward mathematics with both groups, and especially the influence of attribution of effort was high.

COVID-19 Pandemic and Religious Attributions.

A pandemic of this magnitude and the very stringent countermeasures adopted were unprecedented also in terms of its psychological, social, and economic far-reaching effects on people's lives. One of the principal effects of such a tragic and unexpected situation is that of triggering people's cause-seeking process. The exploratory study described in this article focuses on the search for causes carried out by people and prompted by the climate of great uncertainty that still characterizes the situation. In particular, the religious attributions for a possible contagion are examined, both for theoretical advancement and practical reasons, that is to limit the extent of the outbreak. The study involved 575 participants and analyzed the relationship between the reported causal attributions and respondents' characteristics, such as their religiosity. The main findings highlight that religious causal attributions have been chosen very rarely, even regardless of the perceived centrality of religion in one's life. Possible explanations are discussed, such as the ""democratic"" dynamic with which the contagion spread, the lack of gratification linked to the sense of uniqueness, and the sensation of controllability of the contagion given the overexposure to information.","['Attribution', 'Religiosity', 'Pandemic', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)', 'Medicine', 'Disease', 'Physics', 'Pathology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Infectious disease (medical specialty)']","['Maurizio Norcia', 'Elisa Colì']",102,True,Journal of Social Sciences,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Attributional confidence, the ability to predict how another person will behave and think during an interaction, was examined with a variety of intercultural communication variables included as covariates in the ANOVAs. U.S. students' attributional confidence toward the Indian partners varied little based on the partners' appearance. In two exceptions students evaluated partners differently when the students' experiences with a foreign teaching assistant and their interest in study and work abroad were covariates.

This suggests that such findings may reflect a more general difference between correspondent inferences (both dispositional and situational) and causal attributions. Current theory suggests that correspondent inferences are more closely linked to perceived behavior than are causal attributions. If so, then the extremity of behavior should have a greater impact on correspondent inferences than on causal attributions. In support of this hypothesis, our 1st investigation found that perceivers' interpretations of behavior predicted correspondent inferences better than causal attributions. Our 2nd investigation found that a manipulation of the behavior interpretation influenced correspondent inferences but not causal attributions.

Parenting Attitudes and Attributional Style in the First Secondary School Students of kazeron City,2024,https://doi.org/10.47485/2693-2490.1092,0,"Objectives: One of the most important factors affecting the psychological and educational performance of students is the documentation style. Parenting has a significant effect on the attributional style of students. This study was conducted with the aim of investigating the relationship between fathers’ parenting attitudes (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive) and attributional style (internality (locus), stability, globality) in high school students. Results: The results show that there is a positive and significant relationship between authoritative attitude and the dimension of totality and internality (locus), and there is also a negative and significant relationship between the parenting attitude of authoritarian and the dimension of stability in a negative situation (p&lt;0.001). There is no significant relationship between authoritarian parenting attitude and general dimensions and internality (locus), and a positive and significant relationship has been observed between authoritarian attitude and the style of sustainability documents in a negative situation (p&lt;0.001). There is a significant relationship between the permissive attitude and general attribution styles, internality (locus) and stability control (positive situation) (p&lt;0.001).

"Attribution, referencing and commencing HE students as novice academic writers: Giving them more time to ‘get it’",2016,https://doi.org/10.5204/ssj.v7i2.340,5,"The requirement for commencing higher education students to apply principles of attribution in their early academic writing frequently creates frustration both for students and academic teaching staff. Teachers often provide information on the necessity of attribution, and considerable detail on the mechanics of how to reference, and express frustration at the failure of some students to demonstrate this in their writing. In turn, many students appear overwhelmed and confused by the expectations placed on them as early academic writers. This paper explores these expectations and questions current assessment practices, advocating a longer period of formative learning before students are required to competently and accurately apply attribution principles and referencing conventions in their writing. Using the threshold concept framework (Meyer &amp; Land, 2005), it suggests viewing attribution as a ‘conceptual gateway’ through which students must pass in becoming academic writers, and explores some implications of this for teaching, learning and assessment.","['Attribution', 'Formative assessment', 'Psychology', 'Academic writing', 'Mathematics education', 'Gateway (web page)', 'Pedagogy', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'World Wide Web']",['John Hamilton'],7,True,Student Success,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
"Predictors of job satisfaction: attributional style, social problem-solving skills, and sex-role orientation",1994,,0,"This research examines attributes of individuals as predictors of job satisfaction, and forms part of a larger cross-cultural study. Based on the literature, attributional style, social problem-solving skills and sex-role orientation are expected to interact and have implications for job satisfaction. The purpose of this research is to devise and empirically test an interactional model of the relationships. One hundred participants from several organisations completed a survey instrument, the data from which was used to test some of the implications of the model. In general, results provide support for the model and the theory. However, it is apparent that attributions for the causes of positive events are different in nature to attributions for the causes of negative events. For positive events, it seems clear that an optimistic attributional style, positive problem orientation and problem-solving skills, and an instrumental sex-role orientation are positively related to job satisfaction.

After completing the experimental task on a computer, all participants were informed that they had failed the task. The participants then responded to controllability attribution and achievement goal scales. We empirically demonstrated that a growth mindset had a positive influence on mastery goal adoption, while it did not predict performance goal adoption. We also found that controllability attribution had a full mediation effect on the relationship between the presence of a growth mindset and mastery goal adoption; this finding implies that a key element in promoting the adoption of mastery goals following failure is attributing the failure to controllable causes, a belief which arises from a stronger growth mindset.","['Mindset', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Task (project management)', 'Goal orientation', 'Social psychology', 'Goal setting', 'Mediation', 'Applied psychology', 'Management', 'Computer science', 'Political science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Law', 'Economics']","['Juyeon Song', 'Sung‐il Kim', 'Mimi Bong']",49,True,Frontiers in Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

It has been said that if you open any serious knitter's closet, a dozen unfinished sweaters will come tumbling out. Somehow, it's the edges and seams that are the hardest to complete. Documentation—footnotes and endnotes, maps and graphs, works-cited lists, and so on—is the scholar's sleeves and collars, tidied up largely at the behest of editors and their incessant deadlines. Robert Hauptman seeks to shift the ancillary and the marginal from the closets to the center of book history in this lively scholarly monograph. Hauptman begins by making his case for giving documentation our attention. He opens his text with a brief discussion of why we cite, locating the reasons for documentation in six admittedly ""sometimes mutually exclusive purposes,"" including ""acknowledgement, attribution, tracing, validation, protection against accusations of misconduct, and tangential substantive commentary"" (7). He [End Page 501] grounds the process of documentation in contexts of both history and meaning. Hauptman briefly traces documentation's history, beginning with the call to hail one's predecessors in the oral tradition and taking its story up to the increasingly specialized citation requirements of contemporary scholarly publishing that plague particularly the sciences. With these overviews in hand Hauptman examines documentation thematically, exploring eight aspects, including commentary and its role in Talmudic scholarship and medieval texts, the purpose of marginal notes (both published and th","['Documentation', 'Marginalia', 'Citation', 'History', 'Scholarship', 'Attribution', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Library science', 'Literature', 'Law', 'Art', 'Computer science', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Social psychology', 'Programming language']",['Emily Drabinski'],0,False,Libraries & the Cultural Record,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Attributions for abusive supervision: Who do subordinates blame and does it matter?,2023,https://doi.org/10.1111/sjop.12947,0,"Drawing on attribution theory, we propose in Study 1 that subordinates' supervisor‐directed responses to abusive supervision depend upon their causal attributions for the abuse. Using a scenario‐based study ( N = 183), we test a moderated mediation model in which the entity blamed for abusive supervision (supervisor, organization, self) is expected to predict subordinates' behavioral intentions toward their supervisor via affective responses (supervisor disliking). This relationship will be exacerbated when subordinates perceive the cause of abusive supervision as stable. We found that subordinates who blamed themselves or the organization for the abuse disliked their supervisor less and had higher OCB‐supervisor intentions, and this relationship was stronger when subordinates perceived the cause of abuse as stable. Disliking mediated the relationship between supervisor attributions and OCB‐supervisor, but this relationship is not moderated by perceived stability. In Study 2, we explore whether there are additional entities that are blamed for abusive supervision and the reasons they are held accountable. We examined qualitative responses ( N = 107) from abused subordinates to find that they most commonly blame their supervisor, themselves, and the organization for abusive supervision. However, subordinates occasionally blame their relationship with their supervisor and their work group.","['Blame', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Abusive supervision', 'Social psychology']","['Uma Kedharnath', 'Christine A.

In contrast to previous research, helping behaviour was conceptualized as behaviour more or less likely to reinforce challenging behaviours rather than as willingness to expend extra effort in helping. Furthermore, dimensions of positive and negative affect associated with challenging behaviour were used.A total of 123 care staff in adult services viewed one of two videos depicting a person with learning disabilities engaging in self-injurious behaviour. Information about the behaviour's function was manipulated in order to assess reinforcing staff helping responses. Staff completed self-report scales immediately after viewing the video material.There was very little evidence for the predicted associations between causal attributions and both positive and negative affect, and only one significant association between affect and reinforcing helping responses. Given this lack of association, we did not fully test Weiner's prediction that affect would mediate the impact of causal attributions on helping.We found no evidence that Weiner's helping model can be amended to account for staff working with challenging behaviour.

Group Radical Openness: Participants' attributions of change,2024,https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12750,0,"Abstract Background Group Radical Openness (GRO) has been shown to be a feasible and acceptable intervention for individuals who struggle with costly overcontrol. This paper explores participants' reports of attributions of change following the engagement in GRO. Method Fourteen participants took part in qualitative interviews. An adapted version of ‘The Revised Client Change Interview Schedule: Version 5’ was used to capture the experiences of change following the intervention (Elliott &amp; Rodgers, 2008). Research participants were outpatients of a psychiatric hospital who attended GRO. The sample consisted of 14 participants (6 females: 8 males); mean age 44.4 years; and age range 18–58. All participants attended 26, 3‐h group sessions. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify the specific aspects of the group therapy to which clients attributed change. Results The analysis identified three superordinate themes, each with two subthemes. These included Safety and Connection (Safety and Tribe; Open and Genuine Facilitation); Understanding Overcontrol (Awareness of Overcontrol; The GRO Approach); and Carrying GRO Forward (Increased Awareness and Capacity to Reflect; Internalising GRO). Conclusion Group Radical Openness was shown to be an acceptable group therapy treatment for people with an overcontrolled coping style. This paper further clarifies the participants' experiences of GRO and what aspects led to change from their perspective.","['Openness to experience', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Group (periodic table)', 'Social psychology', 'Chemistry', 'Organic chemistry']","['Violet Johnstone', 'Cian McDonough', 'Rachel Egan', 'Katie Browne', 'Amy Corbett']",29,False,Counselling and Psychotherapy Research,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
"Compare attribution styles, job satisfaction, and death anxiety among the staff and operating personnel of Tehran Emergency Service",2016,,0,"This study aimed to compare attributional styles, job satisfaction, and death anxiety among the staff and operating personnel of Tehran Emergency Service. This study was an Ex-Post Facto study. The statistical population included all staff and operating personnel of Tehran Emergency. In this study, the sample size is 310 people, 155 people from operating personnel and 155 people from the personnel of Emergency. The sampling method was a multi-step method. Data collection was done by the use of death anxiety questionnaire of Templer, attributional styles of Seligman and job satisfaction questionnaire of Linz. Findings: data analysis was done by the use of univariate and multivariate two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney and T-test. The results indicated that the mean of attributional styles, death anxiety and job satisfaction of Emergency personnel was higher than operating forces. The attributional style of most people is external style and this can have an adverse effect on their motivation, effort and finally on their success and satisfaction. In addition, death anxiety is more tangible among personnel who have witnessed the death of other people.","['Job satisfaction', 'Psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Test (biology)', 'Death anxiety', 'Population', 'Medicine', 'Nursing', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Environmental health', 'Paleontology', 'Biology']","['Nafiseh Azimipour', 'Alireza Pirkhaefi']",0,False,International Journal of Medical Research & Health Sciences,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Boys were more likely than girls to attribute math successes to high ability and to attribute English failures to low ability. Both genders’ ability attributions for math became more negative from eighth to eleventh grades. Grade 8 attributions of math failure to lack of ability were negatively related to Grade 11 math classroom engagement.

Worker responses to teamworking: exploring employee attributions of managerial motives,2004,https://doi.org/10.1080/0958519042000311426,32,"Abstract This paper examines employee views of why and how managers introduced teamworking at several sites within a steel company. Following a content analysis of employee comments we classify employee views of management motives into four main types: economic, political, institutional and cultural. Employees reported that managers were primarily driven by political rationales and implemented teamworking for reasons of self-interest. The economic rationales for management action were interpreted negatively as favouring shareholders and increasing worker insecurity. The introduction of teamworking also appeared to require a concerted attempt to enforce employee compliance, indicating that culture change was also an important factor. The views employees expressed of management intent are not adequately described by either recent advocates of high performance work systems or the critical perspective on human resource management although they appear central in understanding employee responses to management initiatives in these sites.

Subjects high and low in test anxiety (Sarason, 1972) worked on tasks of varying difficulty, evaluated their own performance, and then responded to two types of attribution items, inventories of major affective reactions (Izard, 1972), and a measure of cognitive interference (Sarason and Stoops, 1978). Meaningful attributional accounts were uncovered; in particular, performance outcome and task difficulty had independent effects on subjects' attributional judgments. Cognitive interference was implicated as a factor contributing to the attributional predispositions of persons differing in test anxiety, and it was a major determinant of affective reactions. In addition, subjects' affective responses were predictably associated with their perceived performance outcome, their level of test anxiety, the difficulty of the task, and subjects' attributional accounts of the factors influencing their performance. Results are discussed in terms of the cognitive components and phenomenological experience of test anxiety and the consequent impact anxiety may have on achievement-related behavior.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Anxiety', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Cognition', 'Test anxiety', 'Task (project management)', 'Test (biology)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Paleontology', 'Management', 'Communication', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Robert M.

The statistical population included all nursing and midwifery students with health anxiety in Guilan Branch of Azad University in 2021. Among them, 30 people were selected by available sampling method and were randomly replaced in the experimental group (mentality-based schema therapy) and the control group (15 people in each group). Mentally based schema therapy was performed in 10 sessions of 90 minutes based on Young et al. (2003) training package in the experimental group. Data were collected using Ellis's Cognitive Distortion Questionnaire (1986) and the Attribution Style Questionnaire of Peterson et al. (1982). Data were collected using cognitive distortions by Ellis, Peterson et al. Data were analyzed using SPSS-22 software and repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: The results showed that mentally based schema therapy was effective on cognitive distortions (F= 3.59, P= 0.035) and causal attributions (F=40.30, P&lt;0.001) of nursing and midwifery students with health anxiety.

Bleeding-Heart Liberals and Hard-Hearted Conservatives: Subtle Political Dehumanization Through Differential Attributions of Human Nature and Human Uniqueness Traits,2013,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2310758,16,"This research demonstrated that human nature (HN) and human uniqueness (HU) traits capture the content of people’s stereotypes about liberals and conservatives, respectively. Consistent with expectations derived from dehumanization theory, people more strongly associated HN traits with liberals than with conservatives, and more strongly associated HU traits with conservatives than with liberals. A trait × target ideology × perceiver ideology × trait valence interaction suggested that both liberals and conservatives more strongly associated their in-group with stereotype-consistent positive qualities, and their out-group with stereotype-consistent negative qualities. Mediation analyses revealed that out-group antipathy, but not in-group liking, explained the relationship between ideology and political out-group dehumanization.

Pattern-based tree attribution,1992,https://doi.org/10.1145/143165.143209,8,"Attribute grammars have been used for many language-oriented tasks, including the formal description of semantics and the implementation of compilation tasks from simple type checking through code generation. Despite their successful use, attribute grammars have some disadvantages, including the monolithic nature of the grammar and the fixed factoring of all attribute descriptions by a single set of grammar productions. Attribute pattern sets provide a more expressive attribution system by using pattern matching, instead of grammar productions, to perform case analysis. Attribute pattern sets can be implemented in terms of attribute grammars in a way that maintains the dependency structure of the attribute system, making it straightforward to convert many of the practical results from attribute grammar theory to similar results for attribute pattern sets.","['Computer science', 'Attribute grammar', 'Rule-based machine translation', 'Attribute domain', 'L-attributed grammar', 'Adaptive grammar', 'Grammar', 'Tree-adjoining grammar', 'Variable and attribute', 'Dependency (UML)', 'Natural language processing', 'Parse tree', 'Matching (statistics)', 'Programming language', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Semantics (computer science)', 'Parsing', 'Generative grammar', 'Context-free grammar', 'Mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism', 'Emergent grammar', 'Linguistics', 'Mathematics', 'Rough set', 'Philosophy', 'Statistics']",['Charles Farnum'],11,True,,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The article contains some data about the alloy structure of sculptures (whose samples demonstrate that it is different in the head, body and pedestals of the sculptures). Additionally, the authors try to establish whether it is appropriate to apply the materials research method to the attribution of Buddhist sculpture. The research was conducted at the Laboratory of Expertise and Restoration of Objects of Culture, Faculty of Art and Culture Studies, Ural Federal University. The authors describe the history of the Dolon Nor School (Inner Mongolia) the sculptures under consideration belong to. Also, they pay attention to the history behind the study of this region by European and Russian researchers of Buddhist art which blossomed thanks to a unique combination of activity of the highest Buddhist spiritual leaders (from the famous Zanabazar to Changkya Khutukhtu) together with the protection of monasteries and workshops by the emperors of the Qing dynasty.

Bridging the gap between child mental health need and professional service utilisation: Examining the influence of mothers’ parental attributions on professional help-seeking intentions,2020,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-020-01682-6,7,"Abstract There is a significant gap between the need for child mental health services and use of these services by families. Parental attributions may play a role in this. This study examined whether mothers’ attributions about their child’s problems influence professional help-seeking intentions in a general sample of community mothers. Secondary analysis re-examined this hypothesis in a subgroup of mothers of children with clinically elevated mental health symptoms. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from mothers ( N = 184) of children aged between 2 and 12 years recruited from the community. Mothers completed self-report questionnaires measuring parental attributions: child-responsible attributions and parental self-efficacy; professional help-seeking intentions; and psychosocial covariates: child mental health, mothers’ anxiety and depression, child age, gender, marital status, education, and professional help-seeking experience. Hierarchical regression modelling indicated that parental attributions explained professional help-seeking intentions after controlling for covariates in both the general sample (Δ F = 6.07; p = .003) and subgroup analysis (Δ F = 10.22, p = .000). Professional help-seeking intentions were positively associated with child-responsible attributions (β = .19, p = .002) but not parental self-efficacy (β = – .01, p = .865) in the general sample, while positively associated with child-responsible attributions (β = .20, p = .009) and negatively associated with parental self-efficacy (β = – .16, p = .034) in the subgroup analysis. Findings were independent of the presence of clinically elevated symptoms, problem type, and severity. Overall, the findings support models suggesting that parental attributions have a role in professional help-seeking for child mental health problems.","['Attribution', 'Mental health', 'Psychology', 'Help-seeking', 'Psychosocial', 'Child and adolescent psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Multilevel model', 'Psychiatry', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science']","['Vilas Sawrikar', 'Antonio Mendoza Diaz', 'Lucy A.

The results showed that students attribute the success of in-group members to internal factors and failure to external factors. The success and failure of out-group members were attributed to external and internal factors respectively.

Tattooed stimuli were rated as more experience, thrill, and adventure seeking as well as more likely to have a high number of previous sexual partners and as less inhibited when compared to nontattooed stimuli, and this was particularly true for male stimuli. It was concluded that people with body modifications, such as tattoos, are perceived differently compared to nontattooed individuals in terms of sensation seeking and previous sexual partner number, this being particularly true for men.

It is your fault! How blame attributions of breach predict employees’ reactions,2017,https://doi.org/10.1108/jmp-01-2017-0023,19,"Purpose Using insights from attributions, planned behavior, and fairness theories, this study examines the effect of blame attributions of psychological contract breach on employees’ attitudes (affective organizational commitment) and behaviors (organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)). The purpose of this paper is to understand whether employees’ reactions depend on the attributions they make concerning who is responsible for the breach. Design/methodology/approach Cross-lagged design in which data were collected from 220 employees and their supervisors in a public company at two times. Moderated mediation was tested using the bootstrapping analysis outlined by Hayes (2012). Findings The results supported the authors’ predictions: employees’ blame attributions to the organization have a negative impact on OCBs (as rated by supervisors in time 2) through decreased affective organizational commitment, but blame attributions to the economic context act as a buffer to the relationship between blame attributions to organization and affective organizational commitment, with consequences for OCBs. Research limitations/implications Attributions can also be made to concrete persons (i.e. supervisor, coworker, self) rather than to just the organization or context. Practical implications When hiring, recruiters should provide accurate and realistic promises to the candidates. When facing hard times, managers should provide additional information to employees and adjust their expectations to the current situation of the firm.

Negative Partner Attributions Moderate the Association between Heart Rate Reactivity During Relationship Conflict and Relationship Satisfaction,2020,https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12609,1,"Numerous theoretical models of relationship distress suggest that strong, negative reactions to conflict are directly associated with lower levels of relationship satisfaction. Consistent with this supposition, substantial evidence links higher levels of subjective negative emotion, more pronounced and frequent expressions of negative affect, and higher levels of negative communication behaviors to lower levels of relationship satisfaction (e.g., Bradbury, Fincham, &amp; Beach, 2000, Journal of Marriage and Family , 62(4), 964). However, the evidence linking stress‐related physiological responding during relationship conflict and relationship satisfaction is less compelling than would be anticipated based on theory. We propose that these theoretically unexpected but empirically well‐replicated findings may be the result of different patterns in association between physiological reactivity and relationship satisfaction for couples with varying styles in how they typically perceive unwanted behavior in one another. The present study tests negative attributions for undesirable partner behaviors as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity (HRR) during relationship conflict and relationship satisfaction in a sample of 60 married couples. A significant interaction emerged between HRR and negative attributions of partner behavior in predicting relationship satisfaction such that higher levels of HRR were associated with lower levels of relationship satisfaction for individuals who typically made more negative attributions for undesirable partner behaviors, but with higher levels of relationship satisfaction for individuals who typically made fewer negative attributions for undesirable partner behaviors. Implications for conceptualizing reactivity during relationship conflict and couple interventions are discussed.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Moderation', 'Reactivity (psychology)', 'Association (psychology)', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Partner effects', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Medicine', 'Alternative medicine', 'Pathology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Communication']","['Colin Adamo', 'Karena Leo', 'Jasara N.

"An Interpersonal Perspective on Depression: The Role of Marital Adjustment, Conflict Communication, Attributions, and Attachment Within a Clinical Sample",2007,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1545-5300.2007.00228.x,71,"Previous studies have focused on the difficulties in psychosocial functioning in depressed persons, underscoring the distress experienced by both spouses. We selected conflict communication, attribution, and attachment as important domains of depression in the context of marital adjustment, and we analyzed two hypotheses in one single study. First, we analyzed whether a clinical sample of couples with a depressed patient would differ significantly from a control group on these variables. Second, we explored to what degree these variables mediate/moderate the relationship between depressive symptoms and marital adjustment. The perspectives of both spouses were taken into account, as well as gender differences. In total, 69 clinical and 69 control couples were recruited, and a series of multivariate analyses of variance and regression analyses were conducted to test both hypotheses. Results indicated that both patients and their partners reported less marital adjustment associated with more negative perceptions on conflict communication, causal attributions, and insecure attachment. In addition, conflict communication and causal attributions were significant mediators of the association between depressive symptoms and marital adjustment for both depressed men and women, and causal attributions also moderated this link. Ambivalent attachment was a significant mediator only for the female identified patients. Several sex differences and clinical implications are discussed.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Clinical psychology', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Distress', 'Psychosocial', 'Multilevel model', 'Moderation', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science', 'Biology']","['Els Heene', 'Ann Buysse', 'Paulette Van Oost']",45,False,Family Process,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

"Incentive salience attribution, “sensation-seeking” and “novelty-seeking” are independent traits in a large sample of male and female heterogeneous stock rats",2019,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39519-1,58,"Abstract There are a number of traits that are thought to increase susceptibility to addiction, and some of these are modeled in preclinical studies. For example, “sensation-seeking” is predictive of the initial propensity to take drugs; whereas “novelty-seeking” predicts compulsive drug-seeking behavior. In addition, the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues can predict the propensity to approach drug cues, and reinstatement or relapse, even after relatively brief periods of drug exposure. The question addressed here is the extent to which these three ‘vulnerability factors’ are related; that is, predictive of one another. Some relationships have been reported in small samples, but here a large sample of 1,598 outbred male and female heterogeneous stock rats were screened for Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior (to obtain an index of incentive salience attribution; ‘sign-tracking’), and subsequently tested for sensation-seeking and novelty-seeking. Despite the large N there were no significant correlations between these traits, in either males or females. There were, however, novel relationships between multiple measures of incentive salience attribution and, based on these findings, we generated a new metric that captures “incentive value”. Furthermore, there were sex differences on measures of incentive salience attribution and sensation-seeking behavior that were not previously apparent.","['Sensation seeking', 'Incentive salience', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Novelty seeking', 'Incentive', 'Novelty', 'Salience (neuroscience)', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Addiction', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Personality', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Neuroscience', 'Microeconomics', 'Economics']","['Alesa R.

Attribution of Flux Partitioning Variations between Land Surface Models over the Continental U.S.,2018,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10050751,31,"Accurate quantification of the terrestrial evapotranspiration ( E T ) components of plant transpiration (T), soil evaporation (E) and evaporation of the intercepted water (I) is necessary for improving our understanding of the links between the carbon and water cycles. Recent studies have noted that, among the modeled estimates, large disagreements exist in the relative contributions of T, E and I to the total E T . As these models are often used in data assimilation environments for incorporating and extending E T relevant remote sensing measurements, understanding the sources of inter-model differences in E T components is also necessary for improving the utilization of such remote sensing measurements. This study quantifies the contributions of two key factors explaining inter-model disagreements to the uncertainty in total E T : (1) contribution of the local partitioning and (2) regional distribution of E T . The analysis is conducted by using outputs from a suite of land surface models in the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) configuration. For most of these models, transpiration is the dominant component of the E T partition. The results indicate that the uncertainty in local partitioning dominates the inter-model spread in modeled soil evaporation E. The inter-model differences in T are dominated by the uncertainty in the distribution of E T over the Eastern U.S. and the local partitioning uncertainty in the Western U.S. The results also indicate that uncertainty in the T estimates is the primary driver of total E T errors. Over the majority of the U.S., the contribution of the two factors of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty is non-trivial.","['Environmental science', 'Transpiration', 'Evapotranspiration', 'Data assimilation', 'Atmospheric sciences', 'Meteorology', 'Geography', 'Geology', 'Ecology', 'Botany', 'Photosynthesis', 'Biology']","['Sujay V.

The present study examined mean level similarities and differences as well as correlations between mothers' and fathers' attributions regarding successes and failures in caregiving situations and progressive versus authoritarian attitudes. Design. Interviews were conducted with mothers and fathers in 177 Italian families from Rome and Naples. Results. Fathers' attributions reflected higher perceived control over failure than did mothers' attributions, whereas mothers reported attitudes that were more progressive than did fathers. Only the difference in progressive attitudes remained significant after controlling for parents' age, education, and possible social desirability bias. Site differences emerged for 4 of the 7 attributions and attitudes examined; 3 remained significant after controlling for parents' age, education, and possible social desirability bias. The authors found medium effect sizes for concordance between parents in the same family for authoritarian attitudes and modernity of attitudes after controlling for parents' age, education, and possible social desirability bias. Conclusions. This work elucidates ways that parent gender and cultural context relate to attributions regarding parents' success and failure in caregiving situations and to progressive versus authoritarian parenting attitudes.","['Attribution', 'Authoritarianism', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Concordance', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Medicine', 'Political science', 'Paleontology', 'Politics', 'Internal medicine', 'Law', 'Democracy', 'Biology']","['Anna Silvia Bombi', 'Concetta Pastorelli', 'Dario Bacchini', 'Laura Di Giunta', 'Maria Concetta Miranda', 'Arnaldo Zelli']",121,False,Parenting,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

"Peer and cyber aggression in secondary school students: the role of moral disengagement, hostile attribution bias, and outcome expectancies",2009,https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.20336,508,"This study investigated the relationship between cognitive mechanisms, applied by people to rationalize and justify harmful acts, and engagement in traditional peer and cyber aggression among school children. We examined the contribution of moral disengagement (MD), hostile attribution bias, and outcome expectancies, and we further explored the individual contribution of each MD mechanism. Our aim was to identify shared and unique cognitive factors of the two forms of aggression. Three hundred and thirty-nine secondary school children completed self-report measures that assessed MD, hostile attribution bias, outcome expectancies, and their roles and involvement in traditional and cyber aggression. We found that the MD total score positively related to both forms of peer-directed aggression. Furthermore, traditional peer aggression positively related to children's moral justification, euphemistic language, displacement of responsibility and outcome expectancies, and negatively associated with hostile attribution bias. Moral justification also related positively to cyber aggression. Cyber aggression and cyber victimization were associated with high levels of traditional peer aggression and victimization, respectively. The results suggest that MD is a common feature of both traditional and cyber peer aggression, but it seems that traditional forms of aggression demand a higher level of rationalization or justification. Moreover, the data suggest that the expectation of positive outcomes from harmful behavior facilitates engagement in traditional peer aggression. The differential contribution of specific cognitive mechanisms indicates the need for future research to elaborate on the current findings, in order to advance theory and inform existing and future school interventions tackling aggression and bullying.","['Aggression', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Attribution bias', 'Moral disengagement', 'Developmental psychology', 'Poison control', 'Social psychology', 'Peer victimization', 'Psychological intervention', 'Cognition', 'Suicide prevention', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Environmental health']","['Chrisa D.

Here, we describe the development and validation of a self‐report questionnaire across three studies, named Hostile Attribution in Romantic Relationships Test. Study 1 introduces the development and preliminary validation ( N = 152). Study 2 tests the validity and test–retest stability of the modified version revised based on findings in Study 1 ( N = 151). Study 3 reports the translation and validation of a Chinese version ( N = 630). The final 9‐vignette scale is the first to specifically measure hostile attribution bias in romantic relationships, with good internal reliability, test–retest stability, and convergent validity. Factor analysis reveals a three‐factor structure reflecting direct hostile attribution, indirect hostile attribution, and benign attribution to partners' behaviors.

The data were collected with an attribution scale composed of 29 questions and with a questionnaire containing 10 items measuring learners' ideal L2 self. The researchers also collected the students' achievement scores to measure the predictive power of causal attributions. The impact of high and low ideal L2 self on causal attributions was analyzed through MANOVA and the prediction power of these attributions for achievement was measured through regression analysis using SPSS 23. It was found that learners' ideal L2 self (high vs. low) influenced causal attributions, including ability, school system, teacher, family and classroom environment. It was also found that the attribution to effort, luck and ability are the best predictors of future exam scores of learners.

Attribution Process of the Organisation Development Consultant: Correct Practice or Manipulation?,1982,https://doi.org/10.1108/eb055448,0,"The degree of direction expected from a consultant is a concern for client and consultant. Indeed, clients often put consultants into an expert role and subsequently determine whether to take the preferred advice. Consultants, on the other hand, tend to downplay their expertise and the desire for direction, preferring rather to provide a client with a number of choices. Neither position is completely accurate. This author contends that consultants attempt to move clients in a preferred direction through the use of various attributions, which focus client attention, provide a basis for evaluation and permit the client to find meaning in a situation.

CUR TIS Ai Vindication of the Press, a thirty-six-page pamphlet published in 1718, was first attributed to Daniel Defoe by William Trent in the twenti­ eth century. Other Defoe bibliographers followed Trent’s lead, and in 1951 the Augustan Reprint Society published a facsimile reprint edited by Otho Clinton Williams. In 1974, W. R. Owens and P. N. Furbank used A Vindication as an example of their argument that the Defoe canon, including over 500 items according to John Robert Moore, Defoe’s leading twentieth-century bibliographer, “rests on somewhat shakier foundations than most others.”1 At an April 1987 ASECS panel in Cincinnati, Maximillian E. Novak disagreed with Furbank and Owens, presenting a case for Defoe’s authorship of A Vindication. Fur­ bank and Owens at that same panel stressed their reservations about internal evidence in making attributions of anonymous writings: “We ourselves . . . would not be inclined to regard even very strong internal evidence as decisive grounds for making a positive attribution in the absence of any shred of external evidence.”2 What external evidence do we have for attributing A Vindication of the Press to Daniel Defoe? In contesting the attribution, Furbank and Owens nevertheless mention the Defoe identification in an eighteenthcentury hand seen by William Trent on a copy of the pamphlet.3 In affirming the attribution, Novak adds to the account of external evi433 434 / curtis dence an advertisement referred to by Trent and the consensus of six twentieth-century Defoe authorities.4 But the advertisement referred to by Trent5 lists only the contents of the March 1718 Political State of Great Britain (Abel Boyer); the Bangorian controversy, about which Defoe wrote, and to which allusions are made in A Vindication of the Press, is mentioned yet there is nothing about A Vindication.6 And as far as Novak’s six Defoe authorities are concerned, one of them, Otho C","['Reprint', 'Attribution', 'Argument (complex analysis)', 'History', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Physics', 'Astronomy', 'Internal medicine']",['Laura A.

In Experiment 1, participants (N = 80; mean age 20.0 years, s = 1.0) were provided with false negative feedback following performance on a blindfolded dart-throwing task. Consistent with theory and recent research, an induced belief that failure was beyond control and unlikely to change led to lower self-efficacy and poorer performance (all F 1,75 > 5.49, all P < 0.05, all η2 = 0.01). A second experiment (N = 80; mean age 22.0 years, s = 2.1) demonstrated that following an induced belief that failure was beyond control and unlikely to change, only new perceptions that a repeated failure was within one's control and likely to change resulted in higher self-efficacy and improved performance (all F 1,75 > 4.53, all P < 0.05, all η2 > 0.004).

The Relationship Between Economic Confidence and Career Decision Making Self-efficacy of College Students: The Moderator Effects of Attribution and Proactive Personality,2011,,3,"The global financial crisis which broke out in 2008 has landed the world economy in a difficult situation.Undoubtedly,the employment of Chinese college students has also been influenced by the ongoing crisis.In this time of hardship,confidence is regarded as an invaluable asset to face the challenge.The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between college students' economic confidence and their self-efficacy to be employed,which was operationally defined as career decision making self-efficacy(CDMSE) in the study,to examine the moderating roles of locus of control and proactive personality between the two,and thereby,to identify the psychological processes underlying self-efficacy.A survey was administered to a cluster sample of 513 college students to explore the associations between economic confidence,career decision making self-efficacy(CDMSE),locus of control and proactive personality.Hierarchical regression analyses were processed to explore the predicting role of economic confidence on CDMSE as well as to examine the moderating roles of locus of control and proactive personality.The results showed that after controlling for the effects of school,gender and location of family,economic confidence displayed a main effect on CDMSE(β= 0.28,p0.001).Specifically,the high-confidence participants had much stronger self-efficacy on career decision making than their low-confidence counterparts.Locus of control served to moderate this association,in which external locus of control predicted a more significant positive association(simple slope = 0.35,p0.01) while internal locus of control predicted a less significant association(simple slope = 0.14,p0.05) between economic confidence and CDMSE.Besides,proactive personality also served to moderate the association between economic confidence and CDMSE in that weak proactive personality predicted a positive association between the two(simple slope = 0.20,p0.01) while strong proactive personality predic","['Locus of control', 'Psychology', 'Personality', 'Moderation', 'Self-efficacy', 'Attribution', 'Social psychology', 'Confidence interval', 'Association (psychology)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Medicine', 'Psychotherapist', 'Internal medicine']","['Kuang Lei', 'Zheng Wen-Wen', 'Chongde Lin', 'Meng Yang', 'Liu Li']",0,False,Acta Psychologica Sinica,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The main research methods are the Mann–Kendall method, wavelet analysis, cross-wavelet analysis, and cumulative curve method. The results show that there is no significant decreasing trend and abrupt change in runoff volume in recent years, the decreasing trend of sediment transport is obvious, and the abrupt change occurs around 2006. The dominant periodicity of runoff is 12–13a, and the dominant periodicity of sediment transport is 5a. There is only a significant resonance periodicity of 3–5a in 1980–1990, which is roughly a positive correlation. The runoff–sediment series can be divided into four time periods, and the reasons for the change in the runoff–sediment relationship are different in each time period. The precipitation factor has a slightly greater impact on runoff and a weak impact on sediment transport, with contribution rates of 21.2 and 7.6%.

Older children were more certain than younger children that God did not scare or punish them and that God loved and comforted them, and helped people.

 However, the mean of all subscales of psychological symptoms were more in girls than boys. Regarding the finding
 of the research and the role of attribution style with mental health, it’s better to make necessary solution for
 formation of positive explanation style from early childhood by families and teachers through enrichment of
 responsibilities, hope and tirelessness and enhancing internal control at children.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Mental health', 'Checklist', 'Symptom Checklist 90', 'Test (biology)', 'Perception', 'Clinical psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Bachelor', 'Stratified sampling', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Medicine', 'Paleontology', 'History', 'Somatization', 'Archaeology', 'Pathology', 'Neuroscience', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Biology']",['Zahra Froughi'],2,False,European Journal of Experimental Biology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
PhotoStyle60: A Photographic Style Dataset for Photo Authorship Attribution and Photographic Style Transfer,2024,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmm.2024.3408683,0,"Photography, like painting, allows artists to express themselves through their unique style. In digital photography, this is achieved not only with the choice of the subject and the composition but also by means of post-processing operations. The automatic identification of a photographer from the style of a photo is a challenging task, for many reasons, including the lack of suitable datasets including photos taken by a diverse panel of photographers with a clear photographic style. In this paper we present PhotoStyle60, a new dataset including 5708 photographs from 60 professional and semi-professional photographers. Additionally, we selected a reduced version of the dataset, called PhotoStyle10 containing images from 10 clearly distinguishable experts. We designed the dataset to address two tasks in particular: photo authorship attribution and photographic style transfer. In the former, we conducted an extensive analysis of the dataset through several classification experiments. In the latter, we explored the potential of our dataset to transfer a photographer's style to images from the Five-K dataset. Additionally, we propose also a simple but effective multi-image style transfer method that uses multiple samples of the target style. A user study demonstrated that such a method was able to reach accurate results, preserving the semantic content of the source photograph with very few artifacts.

Syntactic methods for topic-independent authorship attribution,2017,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1351324917000249,7,"Abstract The efficacy of syntactic features for topic-independent authorship attribution is evaluated, taking a feature set of frequencies of words and punctuation marks as baseline. The features are ‘deep’ in the sense that they are derived by parsing the subject texts, in contrast to ‘shallow’ syntactic features for which a part-of-speech analysis is enough. The experiments are made on two corpora of online texts and one corpus of novels written around the year 1900. The classification tasks include classical closed-world authorship attribution, identification of separate texts among the works of one author, and cross-topic authorship attribution. In the first tasks, the feature sets were fairly evenly matched, but for the last task, the syntax-based feature set outperformed the baseline feature set. These results suggest that, compared to lexical features, syntactic features are more robust to changes in topic.","['Computer science', 'Punctuation', 'Authorship attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Syntax', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Parsing', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Baseline (sea)', 'Task (project management)', 'Identification (biology)', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Oceanography', 'Botany', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Biology', 'Programming language', 'Geology']","['Johanna Björklund', 'Niklas Zechner']",36,False,Natural Language Engineering,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Method: Children were randomized to receive in counterbalanced orders different levels of behavior modification, each for 3-week cycles. In addition, medication was manipulated using a medication assessment procedure. Parents reported daily how successful they were in managing their child’s misbehavior and the attributions for either their success or failure. Results: Parents of children with ADHD generally felt successful in managing their child’s behavior, regardless of treatment condition. In the high behavior modification condition, they were more likely to endorse items that attributed their success to their own effort.

Using open-ended survey data gathered from 610 adult residents in the wake of that outbreak, this study looks at factors related to the ways in which people make sense of their quantitative personal risk estimates. The concepts of informal reasoning and attribution aided this endeavor. Analysis of open-ended comments about the risk of getting ill from a waterborne parasite indicated that explanations of personal risk were consistent with predictions made by attribution theory. Good outcomes, which included having remained healthy during the outbreak, were associated with a greater likelihood that respondents would attribute causation to themselves, while one specific bad outcome, having experienced the illness, was associated with a greater likelihood that respondents would attribute causation externally. This study also examined predictors of whether respondents employed probabilistic language in those attributions.

Relational Versus Attributional Mode of Problem Solving,2010,,3,"Relational Versus Attributional Mode of Problem Solving? Svetoslav Bliznashki (valsotevs@gmail.com) New Bulgarian University, 2 Montevideo Street Sofia 1618, Bulgaria Boicho Kokinov (bkokinov@nbu.bg) New Bulgarian University, 2 Montevideo Street Sofia 1618, Bulgaria Abstract We argue that the concept of relational priming (e.g. Schunn 1996, Day 2007) can be extended from priming of specific relations to generating a cognitive state during which subjects are particularly likely to encode and use relations. We conducted an experiment in which three groups of subjects did different tasks before a target matching to sample task was introduced which contrasted a relationally versus an attributionally similar alternative. Subjects in one condition were asked to solve tasks involving relational reasoning while subjects in another condition were asked to tasks involving only attributes. As expected subjects in the first condition were more likely to pick up the relationally similar alternative while in the second condition the results reversed relative to a control group. In conclusion we argue that this study shows that encoding of relations can be a subject to unconscious context influence. Keywords: relational priming; context dependence; encoding of relations, cognitive state Introduction Since Gentner’s Structure Mapping theory (Gentner 1983) a great deal of research has been concentrated upon analogical reasoning in terms of mapping of higher-order relations. Although the mechanisms employed by the mapping process have been extensively studied little is currently known about the nature of the processes involved in relational encoding. This study attempts to scratch the surface of this complex matter by asking the question of whether the process of relational encoding is subject to certain external and internal context influences. While the answer to this question certainly would not reveal the nature of the encoding process it would hopefully tell us something about c","['Psychology', 'Cognition', 'Priming (agriculture)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Encoding (memory)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Task (project management)', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Botany', 'Germination', 'Management', 'Neuroscience', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Svetoslav Bliznashki', 'Boicho Kokinov']",12,False,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
"Kyivan Rus Kolts with Enamels and Niello: Genesis, Sources of Inspiration, Iconography, Attribution Issues",2021,,0,"Kolts of the Kyivan Rus era is a Ukrainian goldsmiths' brand, personification of the highest achievements of artistic thought of the then jewelers, behind which you can feel the huge inner spiritual culture of the masters and their professional impeccable knowledge of materials and techniques.

people had of the best creative achievements of the artistic ecumene, awareness of many of the then fashionable trends of jewelry art in Europe and the East. Currently a significant part of the available 
artifacts from the heritage of jewelers of the Kyivan Rus era requires verification. After all, using a low level of provenance, individual collections announce fake or “modified” or reconstructed kolts to be

Questionnaires were administered to 173 Year 5 children and their mothers. It was found that measures of depression, life events, and peer's attributional style were all significantly related to children's attributional style. The attributional style of a child's best friend, a year prior to testing, accounted for significant additional variance after controlling for depression and life events. No significant relationship was found between mothers' attributional style and that of their children. Given the emerging evidence about the effect of peer attributional style on pre-adolescent's attributional style, class group interventions could provide benefit not just directly to individuals but also via the reinforcing potential of the individual's peer group. The implications of peer effects on attributional style and the possibility of a critical period for the development of attributional style are discussed with respect to future research, therapy and systemic approaches to promoting optimistic attributional style and thereby reducing levels of depression.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Psychological intervention', 'Peer group', 'Depression (economics)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Macroeconomics', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'History']","['Tracey A.

Understanding the Intentions Behind Man-Made Products Elicits Neural Activity in Areas Dedicated to Mental State Attribution,2008,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhn110,86,"Trying to understand others is the most pervasive aspect of successful social interaction. To date there is no evidence on whether human products, which signal the workings of a mind in the absence of an explicit agent, also reliably engage neural structures typically associated with mental state attribution. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging the present study shows that when subjects believe they are listening to a piece of music that was written by a composer (i.e., human product) as opposed to generated by a computer (i.e., nonhuman product), activations in the cortical network typically reported for mental state attribution (anterior medial frontal cortex [aMFC]), superior temporal sulcus, and temporal poles) were observed. The activation in the aMFC correlated highly with the extent to which subjects had engaged in attributing the expression of intentions to the composed pieces, as indicated in a postimaging questionnaire. We interpret these findings as indicative of automatic mechanisms, which reflect mental state attribution in the face of any stimulus that potentially signals the working of another mind and conclude that even in the absence of a socially salient stimulus, our environment is still populated by the indirect social signals inherent to human artifacts.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Theory of mind', 'Active listening', 'Superior temporal sulcus', 'Mental state', 'Neural correlates of consciousness', 'Cognition', 'Social cognition', 'Neuroscience', 'Cognitive science', 'Social psychology', 'Communication']","['Nikolaus Steinbeis', 'Stefan Koelsch']",25,True,Cerebral Cortex,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Saving Face in Front of the Computer? Culture and Attributions of Human Likeness Influence Users' Experience of Automatic Facial Emotion Recognition,2018,https://doi.org/10.3389/fdigh.2018.00018,2,"In human-to-human contexts, display rules provide an empirically sound construct to explain intercultural differences in emotional expressivity. A very prominent finding in this regard is that cultures rooted in collectivism—such as China, South Korea, or Japan—uphold norms of emotional suppression, contrasting with ideals of unfiltered self-expression found in several Western societies. However, other studies have shown that collectivistic cultures do not actually disregard the whole spectrum of emotional expression, but simply prefer displays of socially engaging emotions (e.g., trust, shame) over the more disengaging expressions favored by the West (e.g., pride, anger). Inspired by the constant advancement of affective technology, this study investigates if such cultural factors also influence how people experience being read by emotion-sensitive computers. In a laboratory experiment, we introduce 47 Chinese and 42 German participants to emotion recognition software, claiming that it would analyze their facial micro-expressions during a brief cognitive task. As we actually present standardized results (reporting either socially engaging or disengaging emotions), we manipulate participants' impression of having matched or violated culturally established display rules in a between-subject design. First, we observe a main effect of culture on the cardiovascular response to the digital recognition procedure: Whereas Chinese participants quickly return to their initial heart rate, German participants remain longer in an agitated state. A potential explanation for this—East Asians might be less stressed by sophisticated technology than people with a Western socialization—concurs with recent literature, highlighting different human uniqueness concepts across cultural borders. Indeed, while we find no cultural difference in subjective evaluations of the emotion-sensitive computer, a mediation analysis reveals a significant indirect effect from culture over perceived huma","['Attribution', 'Face (sociological concept)', 'Front (military)', 'Psychology', 'Facial expression', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Communication', 'Human–computer interaction', 'Computer science', 'Linguistics', 'Engineering', 'Mechanical engineering', 'Philosophy']","['Jan‐Philipp Stein', 'Peter Ohler']",84,True,Frontiers in Digital Humanities,['Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Cancer Survivors’ Beliefs About the Causes of Their Insomnia: Associations of Causal Attributions With Survivor Characteristics,2018,https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2018.1546708,3,"Objectives: Insomnia is common among cancer survivors, yet survivors' beliefs about their insomnia following cancer are largely unknown. This study describes cancer survivors' causal attributions of insomnia and whether these beliefs differ by sociodemographic characteristics. Participants: 160 cancer survivors meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder. Methods: Survivors endorsed how likely they believed 12 different factors were causally related to their insomnia and self-reported sociodemographics. Multinomial logistic regression tested associations between attribution endorsement and sociodemographics. Latent class analysis (LCA) examined patterns of attribution endorsement and whether sociodemographics were associated. Results: One hundred fifty-four survivors (96%) endorsed that at least 1 causal attribution was likely related to their insomnia. Most survivors endorsed that emotions (77%), thinking patterns (76%), sleep-related emotions (65%), and sleep-related thoughts (57%) were related to their insomnia, similar to data previously published among healthy persons with insomnia. Younger participants were more likely to endorse that biochemical factors related to their insomnia (ps < .02); females were more likely to endorse that hormonal factors related to their insomnia (ps < .001). LCA identified three classes (AIC = 3209.50, BIC = 3485.13). Approximately 40% of survivors endorsed most of the causal attributions were likely related to their insomnia; 13% frequently endorsed attributions were neither likely nor unlikely to be related. Older survivors were more likely to belong to the 47% who reported most attributions were unlikely related to their insomnia (p = .03). Conclusions: Cancer survivors with insomnia commonly endorsed that thoughts and emotions contributed to their sleep disturbance. Survivors' sociodemographic characteristics did not meaningfully explain individual differences for most causal attribution beliefs.","['Insomnia', 'Attribution', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Cancer', 'Medicine', 'Internal medicine', 'Social psychology']","['Kelly M.

Misattribution of facial expressions of emotion in adolescents at increased risk of psychosis: the role of inhibitory control,2010,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291710000929,86,"Background By studying behavior, cognitive abilities and brain functioning in adolescents at high risk for psychosis, we can gain an insight into the vulnerability markers or protective factors in the development of psychotic symptoms. Although many high-risk studies have focused on impairments in neurocognitive functions, such as memory and attention, very few studies have investigated problems in processing social cues such as facial expressions as a possible vulnerability marker for psychosis. Method Thirty-six adolescents at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and 21 non-clinical controls completed a face recognition test, a facial affect labeling test and an inhibitory control test. Schizotypal traits and schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using a schizotypy questionnaire and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results The UHR group showed impairments in labeling facial expressions of others, in addition to a spared ability to recognize facial identity. More specifically, the UHR group made more errors in labeling neutral expressions compared to the controls, and an analysis of error types indicated that neutral faces were misattributed as being angry. The degree of misattribution of neutral-as-angry faces correlated significantly with reduced inhibitory control. Conclusions Our findings suggest that misattributing social cues might contribute to vulnerability for psychosis. This social cognitive deficit may be related to problems in inhibitory control, which potentially plays an important role in the selection of appropriate social meaning. These findings may have relevance for understanding the mechanisms underlying prodromal social dysfunction, which should be targeted in future remediation interventions.","['Schizotypy', 'Psychology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Misattribution of memory', 'Psychosis', 'Facial expression', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Social cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Communication']","['Sophie van Rijn', 'André Alemán', 'Leo de Sonneville', 'M.

‘We are dealing with it the best we can’: Exploring parents’ attributions regarding their child’s physical disability using the ‘Four Ws’ framework,2015,https://doi.org/10.1177/1359104515614071,5,"Background: When a child has a disability, parents’ adaptation has traditionally been viewed in negative terms (e.g. grief and stress). However, recent research suggests that parents’ adaptation is determined by their appraisals of their situation, both positive and negative. It would be valuable for clinicians to have a conceptual framework for exploring such cognitions. Aims: This study aimed, first, to devise an attribution theory–based framework for understanding parental cognitions and, second, to examine its usefulness for analysing the appraisals of parents through a qualitative study. Methods: A wide-ranging review of literature on cognitions, particularly attribution theory, was used to devise the ‘Four Ws’ framework: What is the problem? Who is to blame? Why did it happen? When? This was used as a scaffold to organise the data from semi-structured interviews with 36 parents of young children with physical disabilities. Results: The framework proved robust, with a range of subthemes emerging through thematic analysis. Additional themes also emerged, for example, about emotions. Conclusion: The Four Ws framework provides a potential tool for clinicians working with parents of children with disabilities, both to guide general conversations when the child’s needs are the main focus and for more in-depth clinical work with struggling parents.","['Attribution', 'Thematic analysis', 'Psychology', 'Blame', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Conceptual framework', 'Qualitative research', 'Focus group', 'Adaptation (eye)', 'Social psychology', 'Social science', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Marketing', 'Neuroscience', 'Sociology', 'Business']","['Melissa Zschorn', 'Rosalyn H.

Recovery From Ostracism Distress: The Role of Attribution,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.899564,3,"Ostracism is known to cause psychological distress. Thus, defining the factors that can lead to recovery or diminish these negative effects is crucial. Three experiments examined whether suggesting the possible causes of ostracism to victims could decrease or eliminate their ostracism distress. They also examined whether death-anxiety mediated the association between the suggested possible cause for being ostracized and recovery. Participants ( N = 656) were randomly assigned to six experimental and control groups and were either ostracized or included in a game of Cyberball. Two control conditions were used: participants who were ostracized but received no explanation and participants who were included. Immediately after the ostracism experience, participants in the experimental groups were presented with one of four causes for being ostracized, using locus of control (internal, external) and stability (stable, unstable), the two causal dimensions of Weiner’s attribution theory. After a short delay they were administered a mood or needs-satisfaction questionnaire. The results highlight the interaction between locus of control and stability, and underscore the relative importance of different attributions in alleviating self-reported ostracism distress. Specifically, both external and unstable attributions decreased distress, and an unstable attribution led to complete recovery in some participants. Thus, recovery from ostracism may be accelerated when the victim receives an explanation for ostracism that attributes the incident to unstable, external causes soon after the incident. Death-anxiety fully mediated the association between locus of control attribution and mood, but for on needs-satisfaction or the stability of the attribution.","['Ostracism', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Locus of control', 'Distress', 'Mood', 'Negative mood', 'Social psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry']",['Erez Yaakobi'],56,True,Frontiers in Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

How do parental rearing behaviors relate to hostile attributions manifested by adolescents? The mediating role of narcissistic vulnerability,2025,https://doi.org/10.5114/cipp/195697,0,"Background Hostile attributions of intent are linked to externalizing and internalizing problems in children and adolescents. Maladaptive parenting practices are believed to contribute to developing a hostile attributional style. However, there is limited empirical research on this topic. Similarly, research on narcissism often considers the impact of parent-child experiences, but there is a research gap concerning parenting behaviors and facets of narcissism development. Participants and procedure To address these gaps, we conducted a study with 268 teenagers (134 females) aged between 12 and 17 years. Our main goal was to investigate whether maladaptive parenting practices and two facets of vulnerable narcissism are associated with hostile attributions in adolescents. Additionally, based on previous literature, we tested whether narcissistic vulnerabil-ity and antagonism mediate the relationship between parental rearing behaviors and hostile attributions in teenagers. Results Our results revealed positive associations among all variables of interest. Importantly, we found that narcissistic vulnerabil-ity, but not antagonism, played a significant mediating role between maladaptive parenting practices and adolescents’ hos-tile attributional style. Conclusions By shedding light on the mechanisms behind developing a hostile attributional style, our study contributes to a better un-derstanding of this issue and offers practical implications. Specifically, recognizing the importance of narcissistic vulnerabil-ity can benefit professionals working with adolescents who tend to make hostile attributions.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Vulnerability (computing)', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Computer security', 'Computer science']","['Marta Bodecka-Zych', 'Iwona Nowakowska', 'Karolina Sarzyńska', 'Alicja Kuczyńska']",34,True,Current Issues in Personality Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Song authorship attribution: a lyrics and rhyme based approach,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42803-022-00050-x,1,"Abstract In this work, we apply authorship attribution to a large-scale corpus of song lyrics. As a sub-category of poetry, song lyrics embody cultural elements as well as stylistic attributes that are not present in prose. We draw attention to special characteristics such as repetitive sound patterns and rhyme based structures in lyrics that can be key to ownership, and present opportunities that cannot be employed for authorship attribution of other types of text such as tweets, emails, and blog posts. We first create a new balanced, large-scale data set of 12,000 song lyrics from 120 different artists. We propose CNN models for authorship attribution on this song lyric data set, in order to use structural information included in the lyrics, similarly to image classification. We conduct experiments at the character and sub-word levels that mostly reflect positional information. In addition, we use phoneme level features, which intrinsically involve attributes such as repetitions, rhyme, and meter, and represent elements unique to verse-based textual compositions. We attempt to discover idiosyncratic features and consequently author and genre associations by working with variants of CNN architectures that have been successfully used in other text classification domains. Our architecture choice results in a particular focus on lyric attributes residing in neighboring regions, since CNNs fail to apprehend long term textual dependencies. Finally, we empirically evaluate our results in comparison with the findings of previous test classification research from different domains.","['Lyrics', 'Rhyme', 'Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Natural language processing', 'Attribution', 'Linguistics', 'Focus (optics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Poetry', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Literature', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Optics', 'Programming language']","['Tunç Yılmaz', 'Tatjana Scheffler']",10,True,International Journal of Digital Humanities,['Ruhr-Universität Bochum'],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

The successor found that the validation of her legitimacy as a new leader led to actions on the part of organizational members and the attribution of positive observed results to her principalship.

Students reported generally high musical self-efficacy levels and cited ability as the strongest attributional factor in music success. Many significant relationships were detected among the self-efficacy measures and the AMF subscales (p &amp;lt; .01). A maximum variation subsample was selected for interviews designed to investigate experiences contributing to feelings of self-efficacy. Interview questions reflected Bandura’s (1994) four primary sources of influence upon perceived self-efficacy: mastery or failure experiences, social models, social persuasion, and somatic experience. Responses were transcribed and coded according to a researcher-developed coding scheme. Results revealed that mastery and failure experiences were cited nearly 1 1/2 times more by students with low musical self-efficacy than students with high musical self-efficacy.

Thirty-seven patients referred to a pain clinic were categorized as members of either high, intermediate, or low conversion groups on the basis of their scores on the Disease Conviction, Affective Disturbance and Denial scales of the Illness Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ). All patients scored in the high range on Disease Conviction. High conversion patients acknowledge little dysphoric affect and denied life problems apart from physical illness. Intermediate conversion patients also denied life problems other than somatic, but acknowledged high levels of dysphoria. Low conversion patients reported dysphoria and acknowledged life problems which they did not attribute to physical illness. The prediction that the high conversion group would show lower levels of resting skin conductance than the low conversion group was confirmed. Patients in the intermediate conversion group resembled those in the high conversion group in that their resting skin conductance was significantly lower than that observed in members of the low conversion group. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies of conversion disorders. They point to the importance in these conditions of the interaction between dysphoria and the cause to which it is attributed by the patient.","['Conversion disorder', 'Dysphoria', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Denial', 'Psychology', 'Disease', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Medicine', 'Internal medicine', 'Anxiety', 'Psychotherapist', 'Communication']","['N.

"Causal attributions and posttraumatic stress disorder: The relationships among dispositional attributional style, trauma-specific attributions, and PTSD",2006,,0,"The learned helplessness model (Seligman, 1975) and its various revisions suggest that both dispositional attributional style and event-specific attributions may influence people’s responses to events. Attribution theory has been applied to the search for risk and resiliency factors in trauma survivors, but few studies have compared dispositional attributional style with traumaspecific attributions in relation to posttraumatic stress symptoms. In addition, studies of attributions and PTSD fail to take into account the importance to the individual of the events about which attributions are made. The importance of the situation is a key component of the hopelessness model. Attributions for causes of events that are highly important to the individual and whose outcomes are perceived to be highly negative are predicted to be more significant in influencing a person’s response than attributions for events that are considered to be less important and whose outcomes are perceived to be less negative (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989). This study compared dispositional attributional style for relatively commonplace events, attributional style for hypothetical traumatic events, and attributions for experienced traumatic events in order to determine the relationship between attributions and PTSD symptoms. Results indicated that attributions for experienced traumas were most predictive of PTSD symptoms, and the globality dimension of all attribution categories was consistently predictive of PTSD, even after controlling for depression.

Authorship Attribution of IRC Messages Using Inverse Author Frequency,2012,https://doi.org/10.1109/ctc.2012.11,21,"Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a useful and relatively simple protocol for text based chat online, used in a variety of areas online such as for discussion and technical support. IRC is also used for cybercrime, with online rooms selling stolen credit card details, botnet access and malware. The reasons for the use of IRC in cybercrime include the widespread adoption and ease of use, but also focus around the anonymity granted by the protocol, allowing users to hide behind aliases that can be changed regularly. In this research, we apply authorship analysis techniques to be able to attribute chat messages to known aliases. A preliminary experiment shows that this application is very difficult, due to the short messages and repeated information. To improve the accuracy, we apply inverse-author-frequency (iaf) weighting, which gives higher weights to features used by fewer authors. This research is the first time that iaf has been applied to character n-gram models, previously being applied to word based models of authorship.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether adolescents with Early-Onset-Schizophrenia (EOS) exhibited a perceived hostility bias and whether this bias was correlated with adolescents' clinical characteristics (positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, self-esteem) and social competence (social behavior, communication, imagination). Thirteen adolescents with EOS (mean age: 14.7) and 17 healthy adolescents (mean age: 14.2), matched on age and total IQ, completed the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) and several clinical measures of anxiety, depression, social competences and self-esteem. The AIHQ is a self-report questionnaire about negative outcomes that varied intentionality in different situations (i.e., ambiguous, intentional and accidental situations). The perceived hostility, composite blame and aggression bias scores were calculated. In comparison with healthy adolescents, adolescents with EOS attributed more hostile intentions to persons in accidental situations (hostility bias); they also exhibited a higher level of negative emotions (blame bias) toward persons in accidental situations. Both, hostility bias and blame bias were associated with a higher level of anxiety and a lower selfesteem in EOS adolescents. These results suggest that cognitive and emotional biased attribution style in EOS may constitute an important factor of vulnerability to social impairments in adolescents with EOS and suggest that these attributional biases should constitute the targets of early psychotherapeutic intervention with these patients.","['Hostility', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Anxiety', 'Attribution bias', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive bias', 'Blame', 'Aggression', 'Paranoia', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology']","['E.

The existence of social construction regarding gender roles cannot be separated from how the paradigm views the labeling of the characteristics of women and men is. In children, this social attribution usually occurs because of the stereotype of gender roles taught to children.

“Kyrie paschale” in Polish Organ Tablatures from the First Half of the 16th Century – Problems of Style and Attribution,2016,https://doi.org/10.36744/m.4012,0,"This article is devoted to an analysis of the intabulations of the ‘Kyrie paschale’ preserved in the so-called Lublin Tablature and in an organ tablature from the monastery of the Canons Regular of the Holy Ghost in Cracow. The intabulations are arrangements of consecutive sections of the plainchant melody Kyrie ‘Lux et origo’ and constitute sequences of segments (or modules) of a Mass in which organ music alternates with plainchant. In total, the two tablatures contain more than twenty segments of the ‘Kyrie paschale’ for organ, made up of ten modules repeated in transpositions and as variants combined to form various sequences and signed with three inconsistently ascribed attributes: N.C. (Nicolas Cracoviensis?), phÿnk (Heinrich Finck) and Josquin (Josquin des Prez). Based on analysis of the sources, examination of the contrapuntal and formal structure of the segments and comparisons with analogous repertoire from other organ tablatures and with vocal arrangements of the ‘Kyrie paschale’ (as ordinaries both independent and part of a Mass cycle) by identified and anonymous composers, the author of the article has identified new affinities between intabulations and redefined the roles played in their writing by individuals whose names or monograms were partly inscribed in the tablatures. Having found strong arguments to exclude Josquin (an attribution that has often been challenged), the author now attributes crucial roles to two authors of Masses that were in all probability the material basis or inspiration for the organ intabulations: Heinrich Finck and the newly identified Heinrich Isaac. Other individuals involved in the creation and transmission of the segments of the ‘Kyrie paschale’ were anonymous copyists and composers of organ arrangements active during the first half of the sixteenth century (including N. C.).

The present study aims at identifying students' preferred causal attributions of failure and success while experimenting. Therefore, the experimentation-related causal attribution questionnaire was developed and used on a sample of 90 upper secondary school students. Its factorial validity, internal consistencies, as well as the autonomy of its eight subscales—success- and failure-related causal attributions based on students' ability, effort, task difficulty, and chance in experimentation—were confirmed. Further analyses revealed a gender difference in experimentation-related causal attributions. Girls show less favourable attribution styles than boys in case of both, success and failure. With regard to experimentation-related successes, boys show a higher attribution to ability than girls. Girls are more likely to use luck and a low degree of task difficulty as an explanation for their academic successes in experimental settings than boys. Female students also draw on attributions such as lack of ability and task difficulty to account for their failures.

A questionnaire was used to gather data on the children’s self-concept. Analysis of the children’s attributions of success and failure revealed no significant interaction between the groups (with ADHD vs. without ADHD) and locus of control (internal vs. external). However, children with ADHD tended to use external factors to explain their success, whereas those who did not have ADHD more frequently attributed their success to internal factors. Compared with children who did not have ADHD, children with ADHD scored much higher on various domains of self-concept, supporting recent findings on positive illusory bias.

It has long been thought to be at the head of a figurative tradition recognized as peculiar to Apulian workshops and, to a lesser extent, to South Italian workshops generally. As summed up by Arthur Dale Trendall in his Early South Italian Vase-Painting, “The New York krater is of great importance as the first of what is destined to be a long series of Apulian phlyax vases.”2 The word “phlyax” traditionally designates a type of comic actor or play very popular in southern Italy that is depicted in vase painting from the end of the fifth century B.C. onward. The scene on the obverse of this calyx-krater, commonly interpreted as the punishment of a thief, illustrates one of these comic performances (Figure 1).

Regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between causal attributions, emotional responses, and willingness to invest extra time and effort in the service user's care.No support was found for the pathway: low controllability --> increased sympathy and/or decreased negative emotions --> increased helping. However, strong support was found for the pathway: low stability --> high optimism --> increased helping, particularly in direct care staff. High levels of sympathy were also associated with increased helping, the effect again being mediated by feelings of optimism.The data provide support for one (but not the other) strand of attribution theory as applied to inappropriate sexual behaviour.

The findings showed that, compared to Whites, the Black South Africans felt a low but significantly higher external locus of causality and lower control, and experienced a higher level of anger regarding product failure. The level of anger determined the decision to take complaint action, but racial group determined the type of action taken. Blacks complained more actively to retailers and engaged more in private complaint action than Whites.

A content analysis of open-ended attributions supported these hypotheses, revealing that majority group members in Germany who had hosted an exchange student from another continent used significantly less internal and more external as well as culturally sensitive attributions to explain the behaviour described in critical intercultural incidents, compared to future hosts. The effect remained significant when controlling for perspective taking and prior intercultural experience. Moreover, the hypothesis was supported for scenarios describing different cultural groups (regardless of the exchange students' country of origin), suggesting a generalized effect. Problems of selection bias are discussed, and the importance of studying a range of positive outcomes of intercultural contact is emphasized.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Intercultural communication', 'Cultural diversity', 'Cultural group selection', 'Developmental psychology', 'Ethnic group', 'Sociology', 'Communication', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Anthropology']",['Johanna Ray Vollhardt'],81,False,British Journal of Social Psychology,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Parental Health Attributions of Childhood Health and Illness: Development of the Pediatric Cultural Health Attributions Questionnaire (Pedi-CHAQ),2011,https://doi.org/10.1080/10852352.2011.576970,1,"The causes attributed to childhood health and illness across cultures (cultural health attributions) are key factors that are now more frequently identified as affecting the health outcomes of children. Research suggests that the causes attributed to an event such as illness are thought to affect subsequent motivation, emotional response, decision making, and behavior. To date, there is no measure of health attributions appropriate for use with parents of pediatric patients. Using the Many-Facets approach to Rasch analysis, this study assesses the psychometrics of a newly developed instrument, the Pediatric Health Attributions Questionnaire (Pedi-CHAQ), a measure designed to assess the cultural health attributions of parents in diverse communities. Results suggest acceptable Rasch model statistics of fit and reliability for the Pedi-CHAQ.

Simulating Conditions of Learned Helplessness: The Effects of Interventions and Attributions,1985,https://doi.org/10.2307/1129749,57,"We report 2 experiments that assess factors potentially responsible for a proactive interference with the sensitivity of a mother's response to infant signals. Using a version of the ""learned helplessness"" paradigm, mothers' performance on a solvable task was assessed following pretreatments that involved exposure to an infant cry but that differed in the mothers' ability to exert control over the termination of the cry. Each experiment explored the role of varying attributions made by a mother in the development of, or the reversal of, the helplessness phenomenon. The first experiment addressed the question of whether a specific intervention (i.e., providing the mother an attribution for failure) can reduce the debilitating effect of prior experience with failure. The results indicated that the debilitating effects associated with previous failure were reversed for the 16 mothers assigned to the intervention group. 40 mothers participated in the second experiment, which varied attributions assigned to an identical cry stimulus (i.e., the cry was produced by an ""easy"" vs. a ""difficult"" infant). This experiment assessed the effect of varying attributions on the mothers' ability to terminate the cry. We found that mothers pretreated with inescapable cries and those receiving the experimental manipulation of attributing the cry to a ""difficult"" infant showed debilitated performance in stopping the cry when given the opportunity. We propose that models based on learned helplessness theory have value in the study of caregiver-infant relationships, in particular, caregivers' perceived and objective effectiveness in responding to an infant's signals.","['Learned helplessness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychological intervention', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Wilberta L.

"The relationship among the aggressive behavior, hostile attribution bias and childhood trauma in schizophrenic patients",2012,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1674-6554.2012.10.009,1,"Objective
To explore the relationship among the aggressive behavior, hostile attribution bias and childhood trauma in schizophrenic patients.


Methods
135 schizophrenic patients were tested with Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS), the Chinese-version of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ-C) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). According to the score of the MOAS, the patients were divided into the aggressive group (n=58) and the non-aggressive group (n=77). The hostile attribution bias and the childhood trauma were compared between the two groups, and correlation and hierarchical regression analysis were used to investigate the relationships of the variables.


Results
Compared with the non-aggressive patients, the aggressive patients had significantly higher AIHQ-C total hostility bias score (6.27±1.20 vs 5.90±0.97, P<0.05), total blame bias score (8.04±1.97 vs 6.91±2.10, P<0.01) and total aggression bias score (6.17±1.02 vs 5.59±1.04, P<0.01). Correlation analysis showed that the MOAS score, AIHQ scores and the total score of CTQ were significantly positively correlated with each other (r=0.171~0.350, P<0.05~0.01). Regression analysis indicated the hostile attribution bias directly predicted the aggressive behavior(β=0.342, P<0.05)and completely mediated the relationship between the childhood trauma and the aggressive behavior.


Conclusion
The aggressive behavior in schizophrenic patients is associated with the experience of childhood trauma and the attribution style. The childhood trauma indirectly influences the aggressive behavior by the mediating of the hostile attribution bias.

Detection of changes in literary writing style using N-grams as style markers and supervised machine learning,2022,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267590,6,"The analysis of an author’s writing style implies the characterization and identification of the style in terms of a set of features commonly called linguistic features. The analysis can be extrinsic, where the style of an author can be compared with other authors, or intrinsic, where the style of an author is identified through different stages of his life. Intrinsic analysis has been used, for example, to detect mental illness and the effects of aging. A key element of the analysis is the style markers used to model the author’s writing patterns. The style markers should handle diachronic changes and be thematic independent. One of the most commonly used style marker in extrinsic style analysis is n-gram. In this paper, we present the evaluation of traditional n-grams (words and characters) and dependency tree syntactic n-grams to solve the task of detecting changes in writing style over time. Our corpus consisted of novels by eleven English-speaking authors. The novels of each author were organized chronologically from the oldest to the most recent work according to the date of publication. Subsequently, two stages were defined: initial and final. In each stage three novels were assigned, novels of the initial stage corresponded to the oldest and those at the final stage to the most recent novels. To analyze changes in the writing style, novels were characterized by using four types of n-grams: characters, words, Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags and syntactic relations n-grams. Experiments were performed with a Logistic Regression classifier. Dimension reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) algorithms were evaluated. The results obtained with the different n-grams indicated that all authors presented significant changes in writing style over time. In addition, representations using n-grams of syntactic relations have achieved competitive results among different authors.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Stylometry', 'Writing style', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Linguistics', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer science', 'Psychology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy']","['Germán Ríos-Toledo', 'Juan Pablo Posadas-Durán', 'Grigori Sidorov', 'Noé Alejandro Castro-Sánchez']",45,True,PLoS ONE,"['Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología', 'Secretaría de Investigación y Posgrado, Instituto Politécnico Nacional']",1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

It is hoped that the proposed attribution of the choir ceiling to Andreasi may bring to light the hitherto unsuspected achievement of a Mantuan painter whose fresco decoration must have held considerable importance for Fetti, as well as for later Venetian painters of the eighteenth century.","['Fresco', 'Painting', 'Choir', 'Passion', 'Art', 'Art history', 'Chapel', 'Visual arts', 'Psychology', 'Psychotherapist']",['Pamela Askew'],0,False,The Art Bulletin,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Participants monitored environmental and psychosocial elements of the injuries and later answered questions about the cause of the event Results: For a total sample of 1,037 minor injuries, children most frequently designated fate as the primary cause. Further analysis revealed that attributions varied by children's pre-injury behavior and post-injury feelings. Children were equally likely to accept primary responsibility or to assign cause to fate when they were engaged in unacceptable behavior before the event. Similarly, children assumed primary responsibility for the injury when they experienced post-injury guilt.

In the no-choice condition, the actor was instructed how to respond, whereas in the choice condition, he was allowed to select his response. Consistent with previous research, middle-aged adults were less prone to the fundamental attribution error than were young and older adults. This was evidenced by their reduced tendency to make attitude attributions in the no-choice condition relative to the choice condition. Although high levels of both cognitive and attributional complexity were associated with reductions in attributional bias, complexity did not systematically account for the between-age-group differences in performance.

They find pronounced differences in officers' attributions about the causes of crime by white versus minority youths. Further, these differences contribute significantly to differential assessments of the risk of reoffending and to sentence recommendations, even after adjusting for legally relevant case and offender characteristics.

Attributions : relations to attachment and caregiving representations,2006,,1,"purpose of this study was to examine associations among maternal attributions for infant behavior, maternal attachment, and representations of the self as caregiver, as well as to examine the stability of maternal attributions from the prenatal to the postpartum period. Eighty-one primiparous mothers completed measures of attachment and attributions for imagined infant behavior in their third trimester of pregnancy and completed measures of attributions for actual infant behavior and caregiving representations at 6 months postpartum. Correlational analyses and multiple regressions were performed. Consistent with predictions, attributions were moderately stable from the prenatal to the postpartum period. Contrary to predictions, mothers with a dismissing attachment classification predominantly accounted for the change in maternal attributions over time. Also consistent with predictions, the attachment-based positive view of the self was associated with maternal investment in the parenting role. However, contrary to predictions, the attachment-based positive view of the self, rather than the positive view of the other, was also associated with prenatal maternal attributions. There were no associations with overall representations of the self as a caregiver or with postpartum maternal attributions.

The Photo Image of Artworks as an Instrument of Assessment and Attribution (the Case of Painting and Drawing by V. I. Shukhayev),2020,https://doi.org/10.18502/kss.v4i11.7532,1,"This article explores the use of photographic images of art pieces as a tool for assessment and attribution, focusing on Vasily Ivanovich Shukhayev’s (1887–1973) paintings and drawings. Shukhayev was a famous Russian and Soviet artist, who contributed to greatly to Russian art during the six decades of his artistic career. The artist’s works are kept in many state museums and private collections in Russia and abroad, and are also in high demand on the antiques market. Assessment and attribution of his works is, therefore, a pressing issue. Previously photographs of the pieces made at the exhibitions or during the plein-air paintings by the artist himself, as well as other photographic materials showing the artist with his works or their fragments were believed to be of low importance to the experts. The most important photos are those made within the artist’s lifetime or which belonged to the artist personally, especially if they contain inscriptions on the back. Such photos help to understand what the missing pieces look like, to confirm authorship and the creation dates, to find its variations and copies, to detect fake works, to show the artist’s working style and work stages and sometimes to prove that the artist painted the painting over (typical for V.I. Shukhayev). Altogether, creating a compilation of photographic images of works lost or distributed over the world helps shed light on the painter’s artistic career, a task particularly important for research, for museums and exhibitions, for educational work for monographs and catalogues development.&#x0D; Keywords: photographic images, works of art, assessment, attribution, painting, drawing, V.I.Shukhayev","['Painting', 'Exhibition', 'Art', 'Visual arts', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']",['Elena P.

Application of artificial intelligence systems for stylometric analysis of texts as factor of sustainable development,2023,https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202337103007,1,"Investment in human capital, along with natural resource management, is an important indicator of sustainable development. One of the areas of such investments is the creation of artificial intelligence systems that allow for the classification of texts. This paper analyzes the use of artificial intelligence systems for stylometric text analysis. On the basis of the algorithm of the convolutional artificial immune system, a system for stylometric analysis of texts was developed and implemented in software. In order to determine the possibility of using this system to determine the authorship of literary works, it was trained and tested. For this, the works of two authors were chosen: Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Kryukov. This system demonstrated a high quality of text classification and a good speed of work and learning. So, to test the performance of the system, 11 works by Leo Tolstoy and 12 works by Fedor Kryukov were taken that were not used to train the system. All works of these authors were classified correctly. It should be noted that the artificial immune system algorithm can also be successfully used in other tasks requiring text classification.","['Computer science', 'Artificial immune system', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Quality (philosophy)', 'Fyodor', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Support vector machine', 'Software', 'Machine learning', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Epistemology', 'Economics', 'Programming language']","['Rostislav Mikherskii', 'Mikhail Mikherskii']",19,True,E3S Web of Conferences,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333
Novel Topic Impact on Authorship Attribution,2009,,1,"Abstract : Several authorship attribution studies have speculated about the existence of a link between topic cues and author style features. This research presents a experimental protocol for measuring the impact of topic features on author attribution predictive models. We call our technique novel topic crossvalidation, which consists of holding out a single topic in a test set and iterating over choices of held-out topic to compute an average performance score. Using the New York Times Annotated corpus, we perform a subset procedure to build a sub-corpus of 18,862 documents, 15 authors, and 23 topics. With this sub-corpus, we perform a topic crossvalidation. Our experiments differ from previous attempts to model topic/author influence in scope; previous methods were limited to three or fewer topics or authors. Having a larger set of topics and authors should provide researchers with a greater opportunity to explore the variability of style cues represented in sets of authors, as well as the confounding influence of topic. For this reason, we supply document/author/topic identifications so that researchers can build upon our work in a reproducible fashion.","['Authorship attribution', 'Scope (computer science)', 'Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Topic model', 'Writing style', 'Information retrieval', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Programming language']",['Johnnie F.

Testosterone and attribution of successful competition,2000,https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1098-2337(2000)26:3<235::aid-ab3>3.0.co;2-l,64,"Mood, personal merit, and/or its perception have been suggested to be mediating factors in testosterone responses to competition. Previously we have found that personal contribution and attribution were related to testosterone levels after successful competition. To confirm such associations, two basketball teams (n = 17 players) that emerged as winners in two actual matches were studied. Salivary testosterone levels and mood were measured before and after the games. Individual contribution to the outcome was assessed, and personal satisfaction and causal attribution of outcome were reported by players. Testosterone concentrations increased to near significance in Team 1 but not in Team 2, who attributed their victory more to luck than did Team 1. This latter team showed notably decreased vigor, and both teams showed fatigue at the end of the match. Post-match testosterone levels were only significantly, negatively related to external attribution. The results support the idea that causal attribution of the outcome is contributing to the variance of the testosterone responses to real confrontations where the outcome is highly dependent on personal merit.

"The Effectiveness of the Enrichment of Interpersonal Relationship Skills Program on Causal Attributions, Interpersonal Conflict Solution Strategies, Cognitive Coping Skills and Perceived Positive Relations with Others",2019,,1,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of enrichment of interpersonal relationship skills program on university students’ causal attributions, interpersonal conflict solution strategies, cognitive emotion regulation strategies and perception of positive relations with others. In this experimental study with pretest-posttest control-group design and follow up stage, 72 students participated, 40 students in the experimental group and 32 students in the control group. The participants completed the Attribution Style  Questionnaire (ASQ; Peterson & et al., 1982), the Conflict Resolution Styles Inventory (CRSI; Kurdek, 1994), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-SF; Garnefski, Kraaij & Spinhoven, 2001), and the Positive Relationships with Others Scale (PROS; Ryff, 1989). The experimental group received 10 sessions of enrichment of interpersonal relationship skills program (1 hour a session). The results of multivariate and univariate covariance analysis indicated that enrichment of interpersonal relationship skills program was effective in increasing positive causal attributions, positive problem solving strategy, adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and positive relations with others and in decreasing negative causal attributions, non-adaptive interpersonal conflict solution styles and non-adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies in short term and long term.

Attributional biases in subclinical depression: A schema‐based account,2007,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.512,14,"Abstract Non‐depressed individuals exhibit a self‐serving attributional bias, taking more credit for success than for failure. Clinically and subclinically depressed people are less self‐serving, often to the point of making similar attributions (explanations) for successes and failures. The present studies evaluated a schematic account of these distinct attributional biases. Subclinically depressed and non‐depressed participants completed measures of attributional bias (the relative strength of ability attributions for success versus failure), schema‐based optimism (the relative expectedness of success versus failure) and self‐schemas of competence. Two studies evaluated a hypothesis derived from the schematic account: the greater the perceived competence and optimism, the more self‐serving the attributional bias. As predicted, (a) attributional bias scores covaried with optimism and competence scores in both magnitude and valence (or direction), (b) depressed‐non‐depressed differences in attributional biases paralleled differences in competence and optimism and (c) when attributional bias scores were adjusted for the effects of optimism or competence, depressed–non‐depressed differences in attributional biases were eliminated. The schematic account raises questions about the common assumptions that attributional patterns are traits, and that they play a central role in the aetiology and treatment of depression.

It was hypothesized that selfresponsibility would be related to more cooperative ways of communicating (integrative strategies), whereas perceptions of other‐responsibility would be related to less cooperative ways of communicating (distributive or passive strategies). Participants ( N = 67) between the ages of twelve and fourteen read hypothetical conflict scenarios and described how they would communicate to resolve the conflict. Partial support for the hypothesis was found; however, complex details, such as the conflict theme and use of multicommunication strategies, were important variables in the resolution process.

Croatian Combat Athletes’ Attribution Patterns for Their Successes and Failures,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/youth3010025,1,"Successes and failures are integral outcomes to the sport experience. Based on decades of research, how athletes process both outcomes influence their thoughts, emotions, and subsequent achievement endeavors. Attribution theory details three dimensions as to the causes of success and failure. Since the 1980s, attribution theory has found a home in sport psychology literature. However, research across countries requires valid and reliable questionnaires. One such country is Croatia where attribution research is scant. Thus, in a Croatian combat athlete sample, we examined athletes’ attributions for the most and least successful performances via retrospection. Croatian athletes (N = 154) from three combat sports (judo, karate, and taekwondo) who all competed at least once on an international stage completed the Croatian Causal Dimension Scale-II, answered in reference to a specific reason for their best and worst competitive experience. Results showed that the combat sport athletes attributed their most and least successful competitive achievement to psychological reasons more than other reasons (i.e., general preparation and physical preparation). Furthermore, based on a series of two-tailed paired samples t-tests and the nonparametric equivalent, Wilcoxon signed rank test, the participants made, from small to medium in meaningfulness (Cohen’s d), more internal (d = 0.30), stable (d = 0.56), personal (d = 0.30), and external (d = 0.21) controllable attributions for success than for failure (all t-test p-values &lt; 0.01). Our results suggest the athletes made the self-serving attribution bias across both the success and failure competitive events. Our results contribute to better understanding of specific reasons for success and failure and the attribution dimensions explaining the competitive outcomes in competitive combat sport.

"Symptom Reporting and Associations With Compensation Status, Self-Awareness, Causal Attributions, and Emotional Wellbeing Following Traumatic Brain Injury",2006,https://doi.org/10.1375/brim.7.2.95,9,"Abstract Individuals seeking compensation following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often found to report a disproportionately high level of symptoms relative to objective indicators of impairment. Previous studies highlight that level of symptom reporting is also related to self-awareness, causal attribution, and emotional wellbeing. Therefore, the reasons for high symptom reporting in the context of compensation are generally unclear. This study aimed to identify whether self-awareness, causal attribution, and emotional wellbeing are significantly associated with level of symptom reporting after controlling for compensation status. A sample of 54 participants with TBI comprised two groups, namely, claimants ( n = 27) and non-claimants ( n = 27), who were similar in terms of demographic and neuro-cognitive variables. Participants completed the Symptom Expectancy Checklist, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Awareness Questionnaire and a causal attribution scale. A series of independent t tests and Pearson's correlations identified that a higher level of symptom reporting was associated with the following: seeking compensation, less severe TBI, increased age, greater self-awareness, increased post-injury changes reported by relatives, a higher level of mood symptoms, and a tendency to blame other people. Multivariate analysis identified that after controlling for demographic, injury, and compensation status variables, level of mood symptoms and self-awareness were significantly associated with level of symptom reporting. The findings suggest that mood symptoms and heightened self-awareness are significantly related to high symptom reporting independent of compensation status, thus supporting the need for clinicians to interpret symptom reporting within a biopsychosocial context.","['Clinical psychology', 'Attribution', 'Mood', 'Psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Acquired brain injury', 'Anxiety', 'Expectancy theory', 'Psychiatry', 'Rehabilitation', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Neuroscience', 'Biology']","['Tamara Ownsworth', 'Jennifer Fleming', 'S.

Attribution and Self-Evaluation of Continuous Performance Test Task Performance in Medicated and Unmedicated Adults With ADHD,2008,https://doi.org/10.1177/1087054708314604,15,"Objective: To determine if adults with ADHD differed from children with ADHD, in assessing their performance on the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Method: ADHD-diagnosed adults ( n = 13) and adults without ADHD ( n = 17) were tested twice on the CPT and then completed self-evaluation and attribution surveys. Results: Nonmedicated ADHD-diagnosed adults performed significantly more poorly than controls; when medicated, they performed as well as controls and significantly better than when they were unmedicated. AD/HD adults evaluated their performance accurately, whether medicated or not. They also attributed their performance to medication significantly more than to ability or task difficulty. Conclusion: Unlike children, ADHD-diagnosed adults attributed their performance to medication rather than ability or task. It remains to be seen whether this difference is associated with lower self-esteem than non-ADHD adults or if the same outcome would occur in children with ADHD if they were also tested under naturalistic conditions.

Parent Attributions of Ambiguous Symptoms in Their Children: A Preliminary Measure Validation in Parents of Children with Chronic Pain,2018,https://doi.org/10.3390/children5060076,12,"How parents attribute cause to their child’s physical symptoms is likely important in understanding how the parent responds to the child, as well as the child’s health outcomes, especially within the context of chronic illness. Here, we adapt the Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire for parent report (SIQ-PR) and provide preliminary validation in a sample of parents of children with chronic pain (N = 311). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the SIQ-PR structure is consistent with the original measure, with three distinct attribution types: psychological (emotional/affective), somatic (illness/disease), and environmental (situational/transient) causes. All three subscales demonstrated satisfactory to good internal consistency, and temporal stability. Parents typically endorsed more than one attribution for each symptom, indicating that parents of children with chronic pain have a multidimensional interpretation of physical symptoms in their children. Further, parent psychological and somatic attributions, but not environmental attributions, were significantly associated with (i) parent protective responses towards their child, and (ii) the child’s self-reported somatic and psychological symptoms, indicating convergent and divergent validity. The SIQ-PR may be a useful measure for future studies investigating intergenerational and interpersonal models of pediatric chronic pain, and more broadly, to examine parent attributions of children’s ambiguous symptoms within the context of childhood chronic illness.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Chronic pain', 'Clinical psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Biology']","['Lauren C.

When Vulnerable Narcissists Take the Lead: The Role of Internal Attribution of Failure and Shame for Abusive Supervision,2024,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-024-05805-w,0,"Abstract Research to date provides only limited insights into the processes of abusive supervision, a form of unethical leadership. Leaders’ vulnerable narcissism is important to consider, as, according to the trifurcated model of narcissism, it combines entitlement with antagonism, which likely triggers cognitive and affective processes that link leaders’ vulnerable narcissism and abusive supervision. Building on conceptualizations of aggression as a self-regulatory strategy, we investigated the role of internal attribution of failure and shame in the relationship between leaders’ vulnerable narcissism and abusive supervision. We found across three empirical studies with supervisory samples from Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) that vulnerable narcissism related positively to abusive supervision (intentions), and supplementary analyses illustrated that leaders’ vulnerable (rather than grandiose) narcissism was the main driver. Study 1 ( N = 320) provided correlational evidence of the vulnerable narcissism-abusive supervision relationship and for the mediating role of the general proneness to make internal attributions of failure (i.e., attribution style). Two experimental studies ( N = 326 and N = 292) with a manipulation-of-mediator design and an event recall task supported the causality and momentary triggers of the internal attribution of failure. Only Study 2 pointed to shame as a serial mediator, and we address possible reasons for the differences between studies. We discuss implications for future studies of leaders’ vulnerable narcissism as well as ethical organizational practices.","['Shame', 'Abusive supervision', 'Attribution', 'Business ethics', 'Quality of Life Research', 'Narcissism', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Lead (geology)', 'Business', 'Political science', 'Public relations', 'Medicine', 'Nursing', 'Geomorphology', 'Geology', 'Public health']","['Susanne Braun', 'Birgit Schyns', 'Yuyan Zheng', 'Robert G.

TOAST 1.0: Tropospheric Ozone Attribution of Sources with Tagging for CESM 1.2.2,2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2825-2018,61,"Abstract. A system for source attribution of tropospheric ozone produced from both NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors is described, along with its implementation in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2.2 using CAM4. The user can specify an arbitrary number of tag identities for each NOx or VOC species in the model, and the tagging system rewrites the model chemical mechanism and source code to incorporate tagged tracers and reactions representing these tagged species, as well as ozone produced in the stratosphere. If the user supplies emission files for the corresponding tagged tracers, the model will produce tagged ozone tracers which represent the contribution of each of the tag identities to the modelled total tropospheric ozone. Our tagged tracers preserve Ox. The size of the tagged chemical mechanism scales linearly with the number of specified tag identities. Separate simulations are required for NOx and VOC tagging, which avoids the sharing of tag identities between NOx and VOC species. Results are presented and evaluated for both NOx and VOC source attribution. We show that northern hemispheric surface ozone is dominated year-round by anthropogenic emissions of NOx, but that the mix of corresponding VOC precursors changes over the course of the year; anthropogenic VOC emissions contribute significantly to surface ozone in winter–spring, while biogenic VOCs are more important in summer. The system described here can provide important diagnostic information about modelled ozone production, and could be used to construct source–receptor relationships for tropospheric ozone.","['NOx', 'Tropospheric ozone', 'Ozone', 'Troposphere', 'Stratosphere', 'Atmospheric sciences', 'Environmental science', 'Meteorology', 'Chemistry', 'Geography', 'Geology', 'Combustion', 'Organic chemistry']","['Tim Butler', 'Aurelia Lupaşcu', 'J.

Les prénoms de l’an II et les autres :typologie des attributions de prénoms dans la France en révolution,2000,https://doi.org/10.4000/ahrf.127,2,"Une analyse comparative menée en parallèle sur une cinquantaine de grandes villes françaises et sur l'ensemble des 133 communes d'un district rural (Villefranche-en-Beaujolais) conduit à dégager une typologie des attributions de prénoms au cours de la Révolution, et ainsi à mieux cerner le phénomène des ""prénoms révolutionnaires"" qui se manifeste aux quatre coins du pays, principalement entre 1793 et l'anIII. Illustré par une première série de graphiques, le suivi des seuls cas indiscutables, prénoms dénués d'équivoque comme par exemple Floréal ou Liberté, permet déjà de repérer de fortes variations d'une ville à l'autre dans la fréquence et la périodisation des choix de prénoms révolutionnaires. Mais l'élargissement de l'enquête à d'autres catégories de prénoms, répondant à une détermination plus mitigée (Victoire, Rose, Aimé...) ou à des modes apparemment dénuées de caractère idéologique (Caroline, Laure...), s'avère indispensable pour restituer le phénomène dans sa diversité et notamment pour mettre en évidence quelques cas extrêmes de mouvements collectifs généralisés, dans des communes où les prénoms exclusivement traditionnels comme Jean Joseph ou Marie Madeleine se trouvent systématiquement écartés des déclarations de naissance pendant plusieurs mois. Un tel résultat incite à remettre localement en question la spontanéité et la liberté de choix des parents.

Critical study of the erroneous attribution of the book Shajarat al-Kawn to Ibn ‘Arabī instead of to Ibn Ghānim al‐Maqdisī,2010,https://doi.org/10.2478/jriss-2013-00013,0,"Abstract Shajarat al-kawn, (The Tree of the Universe) is a beautiful short treatise on Islamic mysticism that describes the universe and its true origin, the role and place of Prophet Muhammad (peace be on him), and his central place in the sacred presence. According to some manuscripts from the 19th century (13th century A.H.), it is attributed to Muhyī d- Dīn Ibn ‘Arabī (d. 638 A.H./1240) . All scholars endorsed this attribution and it was conveyed via fifteen commercial book-prints. The study by Arabic scholars and orientalists and some translations led to doubt about the origin of the treatise. This was the start of an adventure because what was supposed to be known up to now would become questioned. During my research, I scrutinised two different unknown manuscripts of Shajarat alkawn. There was also a third, very old, manuscript written in the year 835 A.H. All these manuscripts refer to the author and poet ‘Izzu d-Dīn ‘Abd as-Salām Ibn Aḥmad Ibn Ghānim al-Maqdisī (d.678 A.H./1280) and not to Ibn ‘Arabī. Furthermore, I found some proof in the biographical history and the style of writing that pointed to Ibn Ghānim as the author. I came to the conclusion that the work was actually written by ‘Izzu d-Dīn ‘Abd as‐Salām Ibn Aḥmad Ibn Ghānim. From the results of my research, we can conclude that the book Shajarat al-kawn is by Ibn Ghānim and not Ibn ‘Arabī. This study consists of two parts. The first is: How did this treatise, Shajarat al-kawn, come to be universally attributed to Ibn ‘Arabī? The second is a discussion of the doubts that the treatise Shajarat al-kawn was written by Ibn ‘Arabī. This discussion consists of four topics: 1) the problem of copying manuscripts attributed to Ibn ‘Arabī, 2) the catalogues that attributed Shajarat al-kawn to Ibn ‘Arabī, 3) comparison of the text of the Shajarat al-kawn in both content and format with Ibn ‘Arabī and Ibn Ghānim, and 4) the studies and translations of the Shajarat al-kawn attributed to Ibn ‘Arabī.”","['Arabic literature', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Arabic', 'Islamic philosophy', 'Adventure', 'Mysticism', 'Islam', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Fiqh', 'Critical edition', 'Classics', 'Authorship attribution', 'History', 'Theology', 'Art', 'Art history', 'Sharia', 'Linguistics']",['Younes Alaoui Mdaghri'],0,False,The Journal of Rotterdam Islamic and Social Sciences,[],1,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Negative Brand Publicity and Consumer Attributions,2016,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2717075,1,"The main research objective of this study is to investigate the impact of corporate brand dominance on the attribution processes formed for two different types of negative brand publicity, namely performance-related (e.g., product defects) and value-related (e.g., unethical practices). Corporate brand dominance refers as the visibility of a firm's corporate brand in product communications. It is expected to moderate the effect of negative brand publicity on consumer attributions. A firm with a high level of corporate brand dominance may be protected from being blamed for negative events. In addition, the role of individual thinking styles (analytic vs. holistic) is expected to affect the the moderating influence of corporate brand dominance. Holistic thinkers are more likely to consider external context-based explanations for negative publicity and tend to form non-firm-related attributions. In contrast, analytic thinkers are less likely to consider contextual factors and tend to form firm-related attributions which may lead to a greater impairment of consumer responses. In this study, consumers' product evaluations, company evaluations and purchase intentions are specified as the outcomes of the consumer attribution process.

In Experiment 1, some subjects were allegedly exposed to subliminal noise while reading a speech in front of a camera. These subjects were told that subliminal noise makes people feel either unpleasantly aroused or pleasantly relaxed or that it has no effect. Subjects in a fourth condition were given accurate information about how they would feel (unpleasantly aroused) but were not exposed to the subliminal noise misattribution source. In Experiment 2, I replicated the arousing noise and accurate information conditions from the first study and added two new groups incorporating a delay that should preclude misattribution. In both experiments, the alleged presence of arousing subliminal noise reduced subjects' speech dysfluencies during the speech task, whereas the presentation of accurate information alone did not have a comparable ameliorative effect. Thus, both experiments supported the misattribution interpretation of why neutral labels for arousal can reduce emotionality.","['Misattribution of memory', 'Subliminal stimuli', 'Psychology', 'Noise (video)', 'Reading (process)', 'Noise effects', 'Anxiety', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Emotionality', 'Audiology', 'Social psychology', 'Hearing loss', 'Linguistics', 'Cognition', 'Computer science', 'Neuroscience', 'Medicine', 'Philosophy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychiatry', 'Image (mathematics)']",['James M.
