Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries,2018,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21492,76017,"Abstract This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2%), stomach cancer (8.2%), and liver cancer (8.2%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high‐quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence‐based cancer control programs, are not available in most low‐ and middle‐income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

Gender Attribution: Tracing Stylometric Evidence Beyond Topic and Genre,2011,,106,"Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973)) postulate that women's language styles differ from that of men. In this paper, we explore statistical techniques that can learn to identify the gender of authors in modern English text, such as web blogs and scientific papers. Although recent work has shown the efficacy of statistical approaches to gender attribution, we conjecture that the reported performance might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic factors such as topic bias in gender that can make the gender detection task easier. Our work is the first that consciously avoids gender bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evidence to gender-specific styles in language beyond topic. In addition, our comparative study provides new insights into robustness of various stylometric techniques across topic and genre.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Gender bias', 'Robustness (evolution)', 'Tracing', 'Task (project management)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Gene', 'Operating system']","['Ruchita Sarawgi', 'Kailash Gajulapalli', 'Yejin Choi']",21,False,Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,[],3,93.26720375965088,0.001394424931265375,1.0,0.30097609745188575

"Robert Musil, a war journal, and stylometry: Tackling the issue of short texts in authorship attribution",2018,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy055,20,"Abstract During World War I (WWI), between 1916 and 1917, Robert Musil was the chief editor of the Tiroler Soldaten-Zeitung in Bozen. This activity probably also involved authorship of articles and has posed a philological problem to scholars, who have not been able to attribute with certainty a range of relatively short texts to Musil. With this article, we present a new approach that combines philological research with stylometric methods. Exploration of WWI archives and digitization of historical documents were paired with application of authorship attribution techniques, following extensive evaluation. To build the training set, we adapted the ‘impostors method’ by grouping three ‘distractor authors’ (similar to Musil in terms of style) and three actual candidates for authorship. In the test set, we developed two designs for tackling the issue of text length: a combinatory design, where longer chunks were composed by the juxtaposition of short texts; a simplified design, where the texts for attribution were merged with already attributed texts. Results of our experiment suggest that Musil attribution may be disproved with a high level of confidence for ten texts that were more probably written by a less well-known author, Albert Ritter. We carried out a keyness analysis on the specific words preferred or avoided by the two authors, which not only corroborated the results of the quantitative analysis but also findings from Musil philology. Our study showcases the potentialities of using mixed methods in stylometry.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Philology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Certainty', 'Computer science', 'Literature', 'History', 'Art', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Feminism', 'Social psychology', 'Programming language']","['Simone Rebora', 'J.

The Effectiveness of Stemming in the Stylometric Authorship Attribution in Arabic,2020,https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2020.0110114,20,"The recent years have witnessed the development of numerous approaches to authorship attribution including statistical and linguistic methods. Stylometric authorship attribution, however, remains among the most widely used due to its accuracy and effectiveness. Nevertheless, many authorship problems remain unresolved in terms of Arabic. This can be attributed to different factors including linguistic peculiarities that are not usually considered in standard authorship systems. In the case of Arabic, the morphological features carry unique stylistic features that can be usefully used in testing authorship in controversial texts and writings. The hypothesis is that much of these morphological features are lost due to the execution of stemming. As such, this study is concerned with investigating the effectiveness of stemming in the stylometric applications to authorship attribution in Arabic. In so doing, three Arabic stemmers GOLD stemmer, Khoga stemmer, Light 10 stemmer are used. By way of illustration, a corpus of 2400 news articles written by different 97 authors is designed. To evaluate the effectiveness of stemming, the selected articles (both stemmed and unstemmed texts) are clustered using cluster analysis methods. Comparisons are made between clustering structures based on stemmed and unstemmed datasets. The results indicate that stemming has negative impacts on the accuracy of the clustering performance and thus on the reliability of stylometric authorship testing in Arabic. The peculiar stylistic features of the affixation processes in Arabic can, thus, be usefully used for improving the performance of authorship attribution applications in Arabic. It can be finally concluded that stemming is not effective in the stylometric authorship applications in Arabic.","['Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Natural language processing', 'Arabic', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Cluster analysis', 'Attribution', 'Linguistics', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Wafya Ibrahim']",33,True,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,[],3,70.51090970124203,0.00026309904363497637,1.0,0.3001841693305445
$CAG$ : Stylometric Authorship Attribution of Multi-Author Documents Using a Co-Authorship Graph,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.2967449,19,"Stylometry has been successfully applied to perform authorship identification of single-author documents (AISD). The AISD task is concerned with identifying the original author of an anonymous document from a group of candidate authors. However, AISD techniques are not applicable to the authorship identification of multi-author documents (AIMD). Unlike AISD, where each document is written by one single author, AIMD focuses on handling multi-author documents. Due to the combinatoric nature of documents, AIMD lacks the ground truth information-that is, information on writing and non-writing authors in a multi-author document-which makes this problem more challenging to solve. Previous AIMD solutions have a number of limitations: (i) the best stylometry-based AIMD solution has a low accuracy, less than 30%; (ii) increasing the number of co-authors of papers adversely affects the performance of AIMD solutions; and (iii) AIMD solutions were not designed to handle the non-writing authors (NWAs). However, NWAs exist in real-world cases-that is, there are papers for which not every co-author listed has contributed as a writer. This paper proposes an AIMD framework called the Co-Authorship Graph that can be used to (i) capture the stylistic information of each author in a corpus of multi-author documents and (ii) make a multi-label prediction for a multi-author query document. We conducted extensive experimental studies on one synthetic and three real-world corpora. Experimental results show that our proposed framework (i) significantly outperformed competitive techniques; (ii) can effectively handle a larger number of co-authors in comparison with competitive techniques; and (iii) can effectively handle NWAs in multi-author documents.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Information retrieval', 'Identification (biology)', 'Task (project management)', 'Graph', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Botany', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Raheem Sarwar', 'Norawit Urailertprasert', 'Nattapol Vannaboot', 'Chenyun Yu', 'Thanawin Rakthanmanon', 'Ekapol Chuangsuwanich', 'Sarana Nutanong']",55,True,IEEE Access,['Thailand Research Fund'],3,69.6455186304129,0.0002499440914532276,1.0,0.30017496086401724

Dropping down the Maximum Item Set: Improving the Stylometric Authorship Attribution Algorithm in the Text Mining for Authorship Investigation,2010,https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2010.235.243,6,"Problem statement: Stylometric authorship attribution is an approach concerned about analyzing texts in text mining, e.g., novels and plays that famous authors wrote, trying to measure the authors style, by choosing some attributes that shows the author style of writing, assuming that these writers have a special way of writing that no other writer has; thus, authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. In this study, we propose an authorship attribution algorithm, improving the accuracy of Stylometric features of different professionals so it can be discriminated nearly as well as fingerprints of different persons using authorship attributes. Approach: The main target in this study is to build an algorithm supports a decision making systems enables users to predict and choose the right author for a specific anonymous author's novel under consideration, by using a learning procedure to teach the system the Stylometric map of the author and behave as an expert opinion. The Stylometric Authorship Attribution (AA) usually depends on the frequent word as the best attribute that could be used, many studies strived for other beneficiary attributes, still the frequent word is ahead of other attributes that gives better results in the researches and experiments and still the best parameter and technique that's been used till now is the counting of the bag-of-word with the maximum item set. Results: To improve the techniques of the AA, we need to use new pack of attributes with a new measurement tool, the first pack of attributes we are using in this study is the (frequent pair) which means a pair of words that always appear together, this attribute clearly is not a new one, but it wasn't a successive attribute compared with the frequent word, using the maximum item set counters. the words pair made some mistakes as we see in the experiment results, improving the winnow algorithm by combining it with the computational approach, achieved by us","['Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Stylometry', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Task (project management)', 'Statement (logic)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Word (group theory)', 'Ranking (information retrieval)', 'Rank (graph theory)', 'Data mining', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'History', 'Programming language', 'Mathematics', 'Combinatorics']",['Mustafa'],9,True,Journal of Computer Science,[],3,51.676401477005705,7.892971309049292e-05,1.0,0.30005525079916334

Authorship attribution of Morsi Gameel Aziz’s lyrics: A clustering-based stylometry approach,2021,https://doi.org/10.52462/jlls.36,2,"Numerous studies have addressed the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics. These studies have traditionally been based on chronological criteria for determining the real authors of disputed lyrics. To date, there is no agreement on the real authors of these disputed lyrics. This can mainly be attributed to both selectivity and the lack of empirical evidence in such studies, raising questions about the reliability of such approaches. With the advent of machine learning systems and data mining techniques, it is now possible to process thousands of texts using replicable methods. Thus, this study seeks to address the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics making use of these advances by applying a clustering-based stylometry approach. The hypothesis is that lyrics grouped or clustered together are more likely to be written by the same poet. A corpus of 1,089 lyrics was built, including all known lyrics attributed to Aziz and the lyrics of the poets thought to be the real authors of the disputed lyrics. The lyrics were clustered using the Gibbs sampling Dirichlet multinomial mixture (GSDMM) technique, and were assigned to 4 main classes, with the 12 disputed lyrics clustered within Azizâ€™s class. Based on this, it is clear that the GSDMM model is effective and reliable in clustering short documents in Arabic.

This study indicates the robustness of KNN in performing AA on short historical Arabic texts written by different authors. To classify the texts according to the author, KNN was trained with a set of stylometry features including rare words, count characters and 2-, 3- and 4-grams character levels. Various feature set sizes ranging from 34 to 2000 were tested in the experiment. The experiments were conducted on limited training data with datasets consisting of 3 short texts per the author’s book. This method proved to be at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) when selecting the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the KNN classifier achieved high accuracy results with the best classification accuracy of up to 90%, except for the 5-KK using the 4-gram character level.

Computational methods in authorship attribution,2008,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20961,472,"Abstract Statistical authorship attribution has a long history, culminating in the use of modern machine learning classification methods. Nevertheless, most of this work suffers from the limitation of assuming a small closed set of candidate authors and essentially unlimited training text for each. Real‐life authorship attribution problems, however, typically fall short of this ideal. Thus, following detailed discussion of previous work, three scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first variant, the profiling problem, there is no candidate set at all; in this case, the challenge is to provide as much demographic or psychological information as possible about the author. In the second variant, the needle‐in‐a‐haystack problem, there are many thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample. In the third variant, the verification problem, there is no closed candidate set but there is one suspect; in this case, the challenge is to determine if the suspect is or is not the author. For each variant, it is shown how machine learning methods can be adapted to handle the special challenges of that variant.","['Haystack', 'Suspect', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Profiling (computer programming)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Criminology', 'Programming language', 'Operating system']","['Moshe Koppel', 'Jonathan Schler', 'Shlomo Argamon']",114,True,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,[],2,99.10238335011748,0.0062091374297854425,0.6666666666666666,0.2043463962008498

The Federalist Revisited: New Directions in Authorship Attribution,1995,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/10.2.111,274,"The Federalist Papers, twelve of which are claimed by both Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, have long been used as a testing-ground for authorship attribution techniques despite the fact that the styles of Hamilton and Madison are unusually similar. This paper assesses the value of three novel stylometric techniques by applying them to the Federalist problem. The techniques examined are a multivariate approach to vocabulary richness, analysis of the frequencies of occurrence of sets of common high-frequency words, and use of a machine-learning package based on a ‘genetic algorithm’ to seek relational expressions characterizing authorial styles. All three approaches produce encouraging results to what is acknowledged to be a difficult problem.","['Federalist', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Vocabulary', 'Value (mathematics)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Machine learning', 'Philosophy', 'Political science', 'Social psychology', 'Law', 'Politics']",['David I.

Adversarial stylometry,2012,https://doi.org/10.1145/2382448.2382450,183,"The use of stylometry, authorship recognition through purely linguistic means, has contributed to literary, historical, and criminal investigation breakthroughs. Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation , where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation , where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67% of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks. This article also contributes to the field by using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for four current techniques (without adversaries). We have also compiled and released two corpora of adversarial stylometry texts to promote research in this field with a total of 57 unique authors. We argue that this field is important to a multidisciplinary approach to privacy, security, and anonymity.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Adversarial system', 'Obfuscation', 'Subject (documents)', 'Anonymity', 'Writing style', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Computer security', 'World Wide Web', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics']","['Michael Brennan', 'Sadia Afroz', 'Rachel Greenstadt']",20,False,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security,"['Intel Corporation', 'Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency']",2,96.55320577374958,0.002407356249260034,0.6666666666666666,0.201685149374482
Neural Computation in Stylometry I: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Fletcher,1993,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/8.4.203,145,"We consider the stylometric uses of a pattern recognition technique inspired by neurological research known as neural computation.

De-anonymizing programmers via code stylometry,2015,,142,"Source code authorship attribution is a significant privacy threat to anonymous code contributors. However, it may also enable attribution of successful attacks from code left behind on an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft, and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. In this work, we investigate machine learning methods to de-anonymize source code authors of C/C++ using coding style. Our Code Stylometry Feature Set is a novel representation of coding style found in source code that reflects coding style from properties derived from abstract syntax trees.

Our random forest and abstract syntax tree-based approach attributes more authors (1,600 and 250) with significantly higher accuracy (94% and 98%) on a larger data set (Google Code Jam) than has been previously achieved. Furthermore, these novel features are robust, difficult to obfuscate, and can be used in other programming languages, such as Python. We also find that (i) the code resulting from difficult programming tasks is easier to attribute than easier tasks and (ii) skilled programmers (who can complete the more difficult tasks) are easier to attribute than less skilled programmers.","['Computer science', 'Programming language', 'Abstract syntax tree', 'Source code', 'Python (programming language)', 'Stylometry', 'Abstract syntax', 'Coding (social sciences)', 'Syntax', 'Code (set theory)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']","['Aylin Caliskan-Islam', 'Richard Harang', 'Andy Liu', 'Arvind Narayanan', 'Clare R.

The application of principal component analysis to stylometry,1999,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/14.4.445,140,"In recent years principal component analysis has become popular for investigations in computational stylistics, particularly for studies of authorship. The mathematical nature of the theory that underpins the method makes it rather inaccessible to linguists and literary scholars. Consequently, confidence in its correct application is diminished.

An experiment in authorship attribution,2002,,134,"This paper reports an experiment in authorship attribution that reveals considerable authorial structure in texts written by authors with very similar background and training, with genre and topic being strictly controlled for. We interpret our results as supporting the hypothesis that authors have ’ textual fingerprints’, at least for texts produced by authors who are not consciously changing their style of writing across texts. What this study has also taught us is that discriminant analysis is a more appropriate technique to use than principal components analysis when predicting the authorship of an unknown (held-out) text on the basis of known (training) texts of which the authorial provenance is available. Finally, standard discriminant analysis can be enhanced considerably by using an entropy-based weighting scheme of the kind used in latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998).","['Authorship attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Latent semantic analysis', 'Linear discriminant analysis', 'Stylometry', 'Weighting', 'Linguistics', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Medicine', 'Archaeology', 'Radiology']","['R.

A promising way of extending cluster analysis dendrograms with a self-validating procedure involves producing numerous particular 'snapshots', or dendrograms produced using different input parameters, and combining them all into the form of a consensus tree. Significantly better results, however, can be obtained using a new visualization technique, which combines the idea of nearest neighborhood derived from cluster analysis, the idea of hammering out a clustering consensus from bootstrap consensus trees, with the idea of mapping textual similarities onto a form of a network. Additionally, network analysis seems to be a good solution for large data sets.","['Stylometry', 'Visualization', 'Cluster analysis', 'Computer science', 'Hierarchical clustering', 'Data mining', 'Dendrogram', 'Cluster (spacecraft)', 'Network analysis', 'Tree (set theory)', 'Information visualization', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Mathematics', 'Engineering', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Population', 'Demography', 'Sociology', 'Genetic diversity', 'Programming language', 'Electrical engineering']",['Maciej Eder'],43,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,94.14467942262505,0.0015654393096281095,0.6666666666666666,0.20109580751673967
Authorship verification for short messages using stylometry,2013,https://doi.org/10.1109/cits.2013.6705711,102,"Authorship verification can be checked using stylometric techniques through the analysis of linguistic styles and writing characteristics of the authors. Stylometry is a behavioral feature that a person exhibits during writing and can be extracted and used potentially to check the identity of the author of online documents. Although stylometric techniques can achieve high accuracy rates for long documents, it is still challenging to identify an author for short documents, in particular when dealing with large authors populations. These hurdles must be addressed for stylometry to be usable in checking authorship of online messages such as emails, text messages, or twitter feeds. In this paper, we pose some steps toward achieving that goal by proposing a supervised learning technique combined with n-gram analysis for authorship verification in short texts. Experimental evaluation based on the Enron email dataset involving 87 authors yields very promising results consisting of an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 14.35% for message blocks of 500 characters.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Writing style', 'USable', 'Natural language processing', 'Word error rate', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Information retrieval', 'Identity (music)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Authorship attribution', 'World Wide Web', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Acoustics']","['Marcelo Luiz Brocardo', 'Issa Traoré', 'Sherif Saad', 'Isaac Woungang']",23,False,,[],2,92.96878147029204,0.0013418051225383796,0.6666666666666666,0.20093926358577685
Doppelgänger Finder: Taking Stylometry to the Underground,2014,https://doi.org/10.1109/sp.2014.21,99,"Stylometry is a method for identifying anonymous authors of anonymous texts by analyzing their writing style. While stylometric methods have produced impressive results in previous experiments, we wanted to explore their performance on a challenging dataset of particular interest to the security research community. Analysis of underground forums can provide key information about who controls a given bot network or sells a service, and the size and scope of the cybercrime underworld. Previous analyses have been accomplished primarily through analysis of limited structured metadata and painstaking manual analysis. However, the key challenge is to automate this process, since this labor intensive manual approach clearly does not scale. We consider two scenarios. The first involves text written by an unknown cybercriminal and a set of potential suspects. This is standard, supervised stylometry problem made more difficult by multilingual forums that mix l33t-speak conversations with data dumps. In the second scenario, you want to feed a forum into an analysis engine and have it output possible doppelgangers, or users with multiple accounts. While other researchers have explored this problem, we propose a method that produces good results on actual separate accounts, as opposed to data sets created by artificially splitting authors into multiple identities. For scenario 1, we achieve 77% to 84% accuracy on private messages. For scenario 2, we achieve 94% recall with 90% precision on blogs and 85.18% precision with 82.14% recall for underground forum users.

Collaborative authorship in the twelfth century: A stylometric study of Hildegard of Bingen and Guibert of Gembloux,2013,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqt063,80,"Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) is one of the most influential female authors of the Middle Ages. From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to Hildegard is fascinating. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language of which she did not master all grammatical subtleties. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. Especially Hildegard's last collaborator, Guibert of Gembloux, seems to have considerably reworked her works during his secretaryship. Whereas her other scribes were only allowed to make superficial linguistic changes, Hildegard would have permitted Guibert to render her language stylistically more elegant. In this article, we focus on two shorter texts: the Visio ad Guibertum missa and Visio de Sancto Martino, both of which Hildegard allegedly authored during Guibert's secretaryship. We analyze a corpus containing the letter collections of Hildegard, Guibert, and Bernard of Clairvaux using a number of common stylometric techniques. We discuss our results in the light of the Synergy Hypothesis, suggesting that texts resulting from collaboration can display a style markedly different from that of the collaborating authors. Finally, we demonstrate that Guibert must have reworked the disputed visionary texts allegedly authored by Hildegard to such an extent that style-oriented computational procedures attribute the texts to Guibert.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Art', 'Literature', 'Stylometry', 'Art history', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy']","['Mike Kestemont', 'Stefaan Moens', 'Jeroen Deploige']",46,False,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,90.6847935548842,0.0010523961745399055,0.6666666666666666,0.20073667732217793
A Complex Network Approach to Stylometry,2015,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136076,78,"Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.","['Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Complement (music)', 'Complex system', 'Complex network', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language', 'Machine learning', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Topology (electrical circuits)', 'Mathematics', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Combinatorics', 'Complementation', 'World Wide Web', 'Gene', 'Phenotype']",['Diego R.

The best equal-error-rate performance on the keystroke system was 0.5% which is an improvement over earlier reported results on this system.

Style-markers in authorship attribution : a cross-language study of the authorial fingerprint,2011,,65,"The present study addresses one of the theoretical problems of computer-assisted authorship attribution, namely the question which traceable features of language can betray authorial uniqueness (a stylistic fingerprint) of literary texts. A number of recent approaches show that apart from lexical measures — especially those relying on the frequencies of the most frequent words — also some other features of written language are considerably effective as discriminators of authorial style. However, there have been no attempts to compare the attribution potential of these features. The aim of the present study, then, was to examine the effectiveness of several style-markers in authorship attribution. The style-markers chosen for the empirical investigation are those that can be retrieved from a non-lemmatized corpus of plain text files, such as the most frequent words, word bi-grams, different letter sequences, and markers of different nature, combined in one sample. Equally important, however, was to compare usefulness of the chosen style-markers across a few languages: English, Polish, German, and Latin. The results confirmed a high attribution effectiveness of word-based style-markers in the English corpus, but the alternative markers are shown to be usually more effective in the other languages.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'German', 'Linguistics', 'Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Writing style', 'Natural language processing', 'Fingerprint (computing)', 'Word (group theory)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy']",['Maciej Eder'],27,False,Studies in Polish Linguistics,[],2,88.4253105068815,0.0008550718918136733,0.6666666666666666,0.20059855032426954

Three distinct domains, Twitter feeds, blog entries, and Reddit comments, are explored in this work. We determine that state-of-the-art methods in stylometry do not perform as well in cross-domain situations (34.3% accuracy) as they do in in-domain situations (83.5% accuracy) and propose methods that improve performance in the cross-domain setting with both feature and classification level techniques which can increase accuracy to up to 70%. In addition to testing these approaches on a large real world dataset, we also examine real world adversarial cases where an author is actively attempting to hide their identity.

Conversationally-inspired stylometric features for authorship attribution in instant messaging,2012,https://doi.org/10.1145/2393347.2396398,51,"Authorship attribution (AA) aims at recognizing automatically the author of a given text sample.

Hence, this paper tries to fill the gap and proposes two novelties that improve the effectiveness of traditional AA approaches for this type of data: the first is to adopt features inspired by Conversation Analysis (in particular for turn-taking), the second is to extract the features from individual turns rather than from entire conversations. The experiments have been performed over a corpus of dyadic chat conversations (77 individuals in total).

Text Classification for Authorship Attribution Using Naive Bayes Classifier with Limited Training Data,2014,,38,"Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying authors of disputed or anonymous texts. It can be seen as a single, multi-class text classification task. It is concerned with writing style rather than topic matter. The scalability issue in traditional AA studies concerns the effect of data size, the amount of data per candidate author. This has not been probed in much depth yet, since most stylometry researches tend to focus on long texts per author or multiple short texts, because stylistic choices frequently occur less in such short texts. This paper investigates the task of authorship attribution on short historical Arabic texts written by10 different authors. Several experiments are conducted on these texts by extracting various lexical and character features of the writing style of each author, using N-grams word level (1,2,3, and 4) and character level (1,2,3, and 4) grams as a text representation. Then Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is employed in order to classify the texts to their authors. This is to show robustness of NB classifier in doing AA on very short-sized texts when compared to Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using dataset (called AAAT) which consists of 3 short texts per author’s book, it is shown our method is at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) for the selection of the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the significance of punctuation marks is explored in order to distinguish between authors, showing that an increase in the performance can be achieved. As well, the NB classifier achieved high accuracy results. Since the experiments of AA task that are done on AAAT dataset show interesting results with a classification accuracy of the best score obtained up to 96% using N-gram word level 1gram.

Detection of Online Contract Cheating Through Stylometry: A Pilot Study,2020,https://doi.org/10.24059/olj.v24i2.2096,37,"Contract cheating, instances in which a student enlists someone other than themselves to produce coursework, has been identified as a growing problem within academic integrity literature and in news headlines. The percentage of students who have utilized this type of cheating has been reported to range between 6% and 15.7%. Generational sentiments about cheating and the prevalent accessibility of contract cheating providers online seems to only have exacerbated the issue. The problem is that there is currently no simple means identified and verified to detect contract cheating, as available plagiarism detection software has been shown to be ineffective in these cases. One method that is commonly used for authorship authentication in nonacademic settings, stylometry, has been suggested as a potential means for detection. Stylometry uses various attributes of documents to determine if they were written by the same individual. This pilot study sought to assess the utility of three easy to use and readily available stylometry software systems to detect simulated cases of contract cheating on academic documents. Average accuracy ranged from 33% to 88.9%. While more research is necessary to further investigate the reliability of the best performing software packages, stylometry software appears to show significant promise for the potential detection of contract cheating.","['Cheating', 'Stylometry', 'Coursework', 'Academic integrity', 'Plagiarism detection', 'Computer science', 'Software', 'Malware', 'Academic dishonesty', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics education', 'Programming language']",['David Ison'],29,True,Online Learning,[],2,80.6670023497818,0.0004867332307247063,0.6666666666666666,0.20034071326150726
E-mail authorship attribution using customized associative classification,2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2015.05.012,36,"E-mail communication is often abused for conducting social engineering attacks including spamming, phishing, identity theft and for distributing malware. This is largely attributed to the problem of anonymity inherent in the standard electronic mail protocol. In the literature, authorship attribution is studied as a text categorization problem where the writing styles of individuals are modeled based on their previously written sample documents. The developed model is employed to identify the most plausible writer of the text. Unfortunately, most existing studies focus solely on improving predictive accuracy and not on the inherent value of the evidence collected. In this study, we propose a customized associative classification technique, a popular data mining method, to address the authorship attribution problem.

Consequently, naïve application of NSC methodology can produce misleading results. We extend the NSC methodology for more general application to stylometry.

The texts from different authors were represented by tones, tone motifs, and word length motifs as well as rimes and rime motifs. Support vector machines and random forests were used to establish the text classification model for authorship attribution. From the results of the experiments, we conclude that the combination of bigrams of rimes, word-final rimes, and segment -final rimes can discriminate the texts from different authors effectively when using random forests to establish the classification model. This robust approach can in principle be applied to other languages with established phonological inventory of onset and rimes.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Bigram', 'Lexicalization', 'Speech recognition', 'Trigram']","['Renkui Hou', 'Chu‐Ren Huang']",85,False,Natural Language Engineering,[],2,74.296408190668,0.00032887380454372047,0.6666666666666666,0.20023021166318059
Arabic Authorship Attribution,2018,https://doi.org/10.1145/3236391,22,"Law enforcement faces problems in tracing the true identity of offenders in cybercrime investigations. Most offenders mask their true identity, impersonate people of high authority, or use identity deception and obfuscation tactics to avoid detection and traceability. To address the problem of anonymity, authorship analysis is used to identify individuals by their writing styles without knowing their actual identities. Most authorship studies are dedicated to English due to its widespread use over the Internet, but recent cyber-attacks such as the distribution of Stuxnet indicate that Internet crimes are not limited to a certain community, language, culture, ideology, or ethnicity. To effectively investigate cybercrime and to address the problem of anonymity in online communication, there is a pressing need to study authorship analysis of languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, and so on. Arabic, the focus of this study, is the fourth most widely used language on the Internet. This study investigates authorship of Arabic discourse/text, especially tiny text, Twitter posts. We benchmark the performance of a profile-based approach that uses n -grams as features and compare it with state-of-the-art instance-based classification techniques. Then we adapt an event-visualization tool that is developed for English to accommodate both Arabic and English languages and visualize the result of the attribution evidence. In addition, we investigate the relative effect of the training set, the length of tweets, and the number of authors on authorship classification accuracy.

De‐anonymizing Ethereum blockchain smart contracts through code attribution,2020,https://doi.org/10.1002/nem.2130,22,"Summary Blockchain users are identified by addresses (public keys), which cannot be easily linked back to them without out‐of‐network information. This provides pseudo‐anonymity, which is amplified when the user generates a new address for each transaction. Since all transaction history is visible to all users in public blockchains, finding affiliation between related addresses undermines pseudo‐anonymity. Such affiliation information can be used to discriminate against addresses linked with undesired activities or can lead to de‐anonymization if out‐of‐network information becomes available. In this work, we propose an approach to undermine pseudo‐anonymity of blockchain transactions by linking together addresses that were used to deploy smart contracts, which were produced by the same authors. In our approach, we leverage stylometry techniques, widely used in the social science field for attribution of literary texts to their corresponding authors. The assumption underlying authorship attribution is the existence of a distinctive writing style, unique to an author and easily distinguishable from others. Drawing an analogy between literary text and smart contracts' source code, we explore the extent to which unique features of source code and byte code of Ethereum smart contracts can represent the coding style of smart contract developers. We show that even a small number of representative features leads to a sufficiently high accuracy in attributing smart contracts' code to its deployer's address. We further validate our approach on real‐world scammers' data and Ponzi scheme‐related contracts.

The authors have mainly focused on each of the article selected for review (2010-16), by summarizing the authorship detection fields, the corpus, the features of authorship analysis, and authorship attribution techniques used which could provide a platform to distinguish between different research contributions and the diverse techniques used in classifying the author's texts. The details on common tools and authorship attribution techniques published in the recent past would be of importance to the concerned researchers as an aid towards text data mining and future growth in the study of authorship attribution.","['Authorship attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Identification (biology)', 'Data science', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Attribution', 'Information retrieval', 'Natural language processing', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Botany', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Biology']","['Siddharth Swain', 'Gaurav Mishra', 'C.

Analysis of Stylometric Variables in Long and Short Texts,2013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.688,18,"This paper presents some experiments in the task of authorship attribution. We achieve this task by a stylometric analysis of some stylistic markers tested in two Spanish corpora. The first corpus is composed of long texts written by professional authors, while the second corpus is formed by short texts written by students. In both corpora, different text genres are included. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze several stylometric variables to test its capacity as markers for authorship attribution when the corpora vary in size and text genre. We represent the texts as high dimensional vectors and we visualize the similarities between them using multidimensional scaling. We conclude that the length of texts is a factor that affects the discriminatory capacity of the stylometric variables. We also found that there are certain variables that are better than others to identify specific authors and specific text genres.","['Authorship attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Task (project management)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Test (biology)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Philosophy']","['Fernanda López‐Escobedo', 'Carlos-Francisco Méndez-Cruz', 'Gerardo Sierra', 'Julián Solórzano-Soto']",18,True,Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,[],2,68.74958039610608,0.00023678913927147876,0.6666666666666666,0.20016575239749002

Big data or not enough? Zeta test reliability and the attribution of <i>Henry VI</i>,2020,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqaa041,16,"Abstract In 2016, the editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare announced that certain Shakespeare plays could be attributed to co-authors, and certain anonymous plays to Shakespeare, on the basis of non-traditional attribution methods known collectively as computational stylistics, or stylometry. This article investigates the efficacy of a key algorithm used to attribute parts of the Henry VI plays to Christopher Marlowe, the Zeta method invented by John Burrows and adapted by Hugh Craig. Zeta, a test widely used in computational stylistics, is described by Gabriel Egan as ‘by some way the most powerful general-purpose authorship tool currently available’. This article offers extensive independent testing of Zeta. Following criticism of the existing method of Zeta analysis, this article introduces a new, statistically sound method for analysing Zeta results. It investigates a claim that the test is 99.9% reliable in differentiating Shakespeare’s style from Marlowe’s. Examining the conditions under which certain authors were ruled in or out of co-authorship of the Henry VI plays, it determines the effect of disparity in data set size on Zeta’s reliability, as well the effect of small data sets. Several test results confirm that Zeta is unduly influenced by genre. The article concludes that in the light of this study, the small canons of most Early Modern dramatists, particularly where they are genre-skewed like Marlowe’s, do not provide enough data for Zeta to be reliable","['Stylometry', 'Criticism', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Variance (accounting)', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics education', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Paleontology', 'Power (physics)', 'Accounting', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Business']",['R.

In an important recent book Anthony Kenny puts forward a conclusion phrased in terms which reflect the judicious caution of one well versed in philosophy.

However, these studies are generally limited to (i) a small number of candidate authors, and (ii) documents with similar lengths. In this paper, we propose a novel solution by modeling authorship attribution as a set similarity problem to overcome the two stated limitations.

Integration of Static and Dynamic Code Stylometry Analysis for Programmer De-anonymization,2018,https://doi.org/10.1145/3270101.3270110,14,"De-anonymizing the authors of anonymous code (i.e., code stylometry) entails significant privacy and security implications. Most existing code stylometry methods solely rely on static (e.g., lexical, layout, and syntactic) features extracted from source code, while neglecting its key difference from regular text -- it is executable! In this paper, we present Sundae, a novel code de-anonymization framework that integrates both static and dynamic stylometry analysis. Compared with the existing solutions, Sundae departs in significant ways: (i) it requires much less number of static, hand-crafted features; (ii) it requires much less labeled data for training; and (iii) it can be readily extended to new programmers once their stylometry information becomes available Through extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Sundae delivers strong empirical performance. For example, under the setting of 229 programmers and 9 problems, it outperforms the state-of-art method by a margin of 45.65% on Python code de-anonymization.

In our study, we faced building a balanced corpus from few available resources, and took extensive evaluation measures to deal with unclear stylometric signals. We use a variety of established attribution and verification methods, and introduce a novel evaluation procedure of examining historic texts with scarce corpora.

"Does Size Matter?

Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size. Although the tests have been performed using the Delta method ( Burrows, J.F . (2002). ‘Delta’: a measure of stylistic difference and a guide to likely authorship.

Four popular distance measures established in stylometric research are evaluated for the genre detection task. Findings The results of the experiments show that stylometry-based genre clustering and classification align well with human-defined genre. The evidence suggests that genre style signals exist for Classical Arabic and can be used to support the task of automated genre detection. Originality/value This work targets the task of genre detection in Classical Arabic text using stylometric features, an approach that has only been previously applied to Arabic authorship attribution.

The features are based on the concept of network motifs: small graph local substructures which have been used successfully in characterizing global network dynamics. The text is transformed into a network, where words become nodes and their adjacencies in a sentence are represented through links. Motifs of size 3 are then extracted from this network and their distribution is used as a signature for the corresponding translator.

The biographies describe the lives of emperors and usurpers of a great part of the second and third centuries of our era, and constitute an imperfect, yet important source of information on this poorly documented time. The attempts to demonstrate single authorship have been based upon internal evidence and linguistic analysis. This paper describes various statistical analyses of word frequencies of the fully lemmatized and disambiguated texts of the work, and demonstrates that not only has multiple authorship not been disproved, but also that the manuscript tradition attributing specific biographies to stated authors has very clearly not been overturned.","['Attribution', 'Authorship attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Literature', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Penelope J.

Stylometrics of artwork: uses and limitations,2010,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.838849,10,"A number of digital image analysis techniques have been developed in recent years to address art historical questions. These techniques allow non-destructive analyses of art images that can target outstanding problems of attribution, historical ordering, and other stylistic dimensions. However, great care must be taken in designing the comparisons to which these techniques are applied. In this paper, we review recent work by our lab and by others aimed at establishing a toolbox of stylometrics, and we discuss some of the uses and limitations of these methods. We describe a technique that provides robust classification of authentic drawings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and we demonstrate new techniques for art historical analysis applied to the works of other masters. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of two low-level statistics (the slope of the log amplitude spectrum and color histogram correlation) to analyze the works of Picasso and Braque. Finally, we show that face detection and recognition techniques may play a useful role in the attribution of works of art. The rationale for employing vision coding-like methods (e.g., sparse coding) in stylometry is also reviewed. We conclude that generic authentication tools are unlikely to provide reliable stylometric predictions but that with careful construction of comparison sets - which we believe must be done in close collaboration with art historians - these techniques provide important predictions that can be weighed against other art historical evidence. We argue further that concurrent predictions derived from analysis of many independent dimensions of image data (e.g., color, luminance, and spatial statistics) provide the strongest evidence for digital stylometric determinations.","['Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Toolbox', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Histogram', 'Coding (social sciences)', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Programming language']","['James M.

Authorship Attribution for a Resource Poor Language—Urdu,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3487061,10,"Authorship attribution refers to examining the writing style of authors to determine the likelihood of the original author of a document from a given set of potential authors. Due to the wide range of authorship attribution applications, a plethora of studies have been conducted for various Western, as well as Asian, languages. However, authorship attribution research in the Urdu language has just begun, although Urdu is widely acknowledged as a prominent South Asian language. Furthermore, the existing studies on authorship attribution in Urdu have addressed a considerably easier problem of having less than 20 candidate authors, which is far from the real-world settings. Therefore, the findings from these studies may not be applicable to the real-world settings. To that end, we have made three key contributions: First, we have developed a large authorship attribution corpus for Urdu, which is a low-resource language. The corpus is composed of over 2.6 million tokens and 21,938 news articles by 94 authors, which makes it a closer substitute to the real-world settings. Second, we have analyzed hundreds of stylometry features used in the literature to identify 194 features that are applicable to the Urdu language and developed a taxonomy of these features. Finally, we have performed 66 experiments using two heterogeneous datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of four traditional and three deep learning techniques. The experimental results show the following: (a) Our developed corpus is many folds larger than the existing corpora, and it is more challenging than its counterparts for the authorship attribution task, and (b) Convolutional Neutral Networks is the most effective technique, as it achieved a nearly perfect F1 score of 0.989 for an existing corpus and 0.910 for our newly developed corpus.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Urdu', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Resource (disambiguation)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Taxonomy (biology)', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Computer network', 'Philosophy', 'Botany', 'Biology', 'Programming language', 'Archaeology']","['Zulqarnain Nazir', 'Khurram Shahzad', 'Muhammad Kamran Malik', 'Waheed Anwar', 'Imran Sarwar Bajwa', 'Khawar Mehmood']",44,False,ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing,[],2,59.23766364551864,0.00013154952181748818,0.6666666666666666,0.20009208466527223

Development of the quantitative method for automated text content authorship attribution based on the statistical analysis of N-grams distribution,2019,https://doi.org/10.15587/1729-4061.2019.186834,9,"The peculiarities of the application of linguo-statistics technologies for the identification of the style of the author of text content of scientific and technical profile are considered. Quantitative linguistic analysis of a text uses the benefits of content monitoring based on the NLP methods to identify and analyze the set of stop words, keywords, set phrases and to study N-gram. The latter are used in the linguometry methods to determine in per cent if the given text belongs to a particular author. The quantitative method for automatic text content authorship attribution was developed based on statistical analysis of the 3-gram distribution. The approach to the implementation of identification of the author of the text in the Ukrainian language of the scientific and technical profile was proposed. Experimental results of the proposed method to determine the belonging of the analyzed text to a specific author in the presence of the reference text were obtained. Application of the linguo-statistical analysis of the 3-grams to a set of articles will make it possible to form a subset of publications that are similar in linguistic descriptions. Imposing additional conditions in the form of statistical and quantitative analyses (a set of keywords, set expressions, stylometric, linguometric analyses, etc.) on a subset will allow a significant reduction of this subset by specifying the list of the most likely author. For qualitative and effective content analysis when determining the degree of authorship of a particular author, we propose to analyze the reference text and the one under consideration at several stages: linguometric analysis of the coefficients of the diversity of the author's speech, stylometric analysis, analysis of set expressions, linguo-statistical analysis of 3-grams.

Register variation explains stylometric authorship analysis,2023,https://doi.org/10.1515/cllt-2022-0040,8,"Abstract For centuries, investigations of disputed authorship have shown that people have unique styles of writing. Given sufficient data, it is generally possible to distinguish between the writings of a small group of authors, for example, through the multivariate analysis of the relative frequencies of common function words. There is, however, no accepted explanation for why this type of stylometric analysis is successful. Authorship analysts often argue that authors write in subtly different dialects, but the analysis of individual words is not licensed by standard theories of sociolinguistic variation. Alternatively, stylometric analysis is consistent with standard theories of register variation. In this paper, I argue that stylometric methods work because authors write in subtly different registers. To support this claim, I present the results of parallel stylometric and multidimensional register analyses of a corpus of newspaper articles written by two columnists. I demonstrate that both analyses not only distinguish between these authors but identify the same underlying patterns of linguistic variation. I therefore propose that register variation, as opposed to dialect variation, provides a basis for explaining these differences and for explaining stylometric analyses of authorship more generally.","['Variation (astronomy)', 'Register (sociolinguistics)', 'Stylometry', 'Newspaper', 'Computer science', 'Linguistics', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Astrophysics', 'Media studies']",['Jack Grieve'],38,True,Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory,[],2,55.869754951325945,0.00010523961745399055,0.6666666666666666,0.20007366773221777

Stylometry and Numerals Usage: Benford’s Law and Beyond,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/stats4040060,7,"We suggest two approaches to the statistical analysis of texts, both based on the study of numerals occurrence in literary texts. The first approach is related to Benford’s Law and the analysis of the frequency distribution of various leading digits of numerals contained in the text. In coherent literary texts, the share of the leading digit 1 is even larger than prescribed by Benford’s Law and can reach 50 percent. The frequencies of occurrence of the digit 1, as well as, to a lesser extent, the digits 2 and 3, are usually a characteristic the author’s style feature, manifested in all (sufficiently long) literary texts of any author. This approach is convenient for testing whether a group of texts has common authorship: the latter is dubious if the frequency distributions are sufficiently different. The second approach is the extension of the first one and requires the study of the frequency distribution of numerals themselves (not their leading digits).

Previously, authorship attributions focused mainly on unmasking the author of long pieces of digital texts but in this study, we are going to do the same for short texts that are shared on social platforms and boards.

Authorship Attribution on Bengali Literature using Stylometric Features and Neural Network,2018,https://doi.org/10.1109/ceeict.2018.8628106,7,"Every writer has his/her personal writing style.

Various kinds of features such as frequently used words, word length, sentence length, WH words, Number, etc. were analyzed to identify and specify a writer's writing style. A statistical analysis of different articles by different writers was created that can identify the real author. An artificial neural network model was developed to identify a writer from an unknown document and it achieved above 85% accuracy rate for each writer.

Finding characteristic features in stylometric analysis,2015,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqv048,7,"The usual focus in authorship studies is on authorship attribution, i.e. determining which author (of a given set) wrote a piece of unknown provenance. The usual setting involves a small number of candidate authors, which means that the focus quickly revolves around a search for features that discriminate among the candidates. Whether the features that serve to discriminate among the authors are characteristic is then not of primary importance. We respectfully suggest an alternative in this article, namely a focus on seeking features that are characteristic for an author with respect to others. To determine an author’s characteristic features, we first seek elements that he or she uses consistently, which we therefore regard as ‘representative’, but we likewise seek elements which the author uses ‘distinctively’ in comparison to an opposing author. We test the idea on a task recently proposed that compares Charles Dickens to both Wilkie Collins and a larger reference set comprising several authors’ works from the 18th and 19th century. We then compare the use of representative and distinctive features to Burrows’ ‘Delta’ and Hoovers’ ‘CoV Tuning’; we find that our method bears little similarity with either method in terms of characteristic feature selection. We show that our method achieves reliable and consistent results in the two-author comparison and fair results in the multi-author one, measured by separation ability in clustering.","['Focus (optics)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Stylometry', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Computer science', 'Task (project management)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Cluster analysis', 'Selection (genetic algorithm)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Natural language processing', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Linguistics', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Engineering', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Systems engineering', 'Optics', 'Programming language']","['Carmen Klaussner', 'John Nerbonne', 'Çağrı Çöltekin']",21,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,53.91171534071836,9.208466527224174e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20006445926569055
A Scientometric Study of the Stylometric Research Field,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/informatics9030060,6,"Stylometry has gained great popularity in digital humanities and social sciences. Many works on stylometry have recently been reported. However, there is a research gap regarding review studies in this field from a bibliometric and evolutionary perspective. Therefore, in this paper, a bibliometric analysis of publications from the Scopus database in the stylometric research field was proposed. Then, research articles published between 1968 and 2021 were collected and analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package for bibliometric analysis via the Biblioshiny web interface. Empirical results were also presented in terms of the performance analysis and the science mapping analysis. From these results, it is concluded that there has been a strong growth in stylometry research in recent years, while the USA, Poland, and the UK are the most productive countries, and this is due to many strong research partnerships. It was also concluded that the research topics of most articles, based on author keywords, focused on two broad thematic categories: (1) the main tasks in stylometry and (2) methodological approaches (statistics and machine learning methods).","['Stylometry', 'Popularity', 'Scopus', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Web of science', 'Data science', 'Bibliometrics', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Scientometrics', 'Computer science', 'Library science', 'Political science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Mathematics', 'MEDLINE', 'Law', 'Pure mathematics']",['Panagiotis D.

Towards a Linguistic Stylometric Model for the Authorship Detection in Cybercrime Investigations,2019,https://doi.org/10.5539/ijel.v9n5p182,6,"This study proposes an integrated framework that considers letter-pair frequencies/combinations along with the lexical features of documents as a means to identifying the authorship of short texts posted anonymously on social media. Taking a quantitative morpho-lexical approach, this study tests the hypothesis that letter information, or mapping, can identify unique stylistic features. As such, stable word combinations and morphological patterns can be used successfully for authorship detection in relation to very short texts. This method offers significant potential in the fight against online hate speech, which is often posted anonymously and where authorship is difficult to identify. The data analyzed is from a corpus of 12,240 tweets derived from 87 Twitter accounts. A self-organizing map (SOM) model was used to classify input patterns in the tweets that shared common features. Tweets grouped in a particular class displayed features that suggested they were written by a particular author. The results indicate that the accuracy of classification according to the proposed system was around 76%. Up to 22% of this accuracy was lost, however, when only distinctive words were used and 26% was lost when the classification procedure was based solely on letter combinations and morphological patterns. The integration of letter-pairs and morphological patterns had the advantage of improving accuracy when determining the author of a given tweet. This indicates that the integration of different linguistic variables into an integrated system leads to better performance in classifying very short texts. It is also clear that the use of a self-organizing map (SOM) led to better clustering performance because of its capacity to integrate two different linguistic levels for each author profile.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Class (philosophy)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Word (group theory)', 'Part of speech', 'Stylometry', 'Relation (database)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Data mining', 'Philosophy']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Aldawsari Bader Deraan']",25,True,International Journal of English Linguistics,[],2,51.676401477005705,7.892971309049292e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20005525079916334

To this end we compare documents known to be written by Wittgenstein in person; the ""Diktat f&uuml;r Schlick""; and samples of some of Schlick's and Waismann's (the potential amanuenses) own writings. Using the ""Stylometry with R"" package of Eder and Rybicki, the degree of similarity and dissimilarity between documents is calculated by Burrows' delta measure, and the results are displayed using Cluster Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling and Bootstrap Consensus Trees.&nbsp; The documents are each characterised by the frequencies of the 300 most frequent words in the entire corpus, normalised by document length.

Deception in Authorship Attribution,2013,,4,"In digital forensics, questions often arise about the authors of documents: their identity, demographic background, and whether they can be linked to other documents. The field of stylometry uses linguistic features and machine learning techniques to answer these questions. While stylometry techniques can identify authors with high accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios, their accuracy is reduced to random guessing when faced with authors who intentionally obfuscate their writing style or attempt to imitate that of another author. Most authorship attribution methods were not evaluated in challenging real-world datasets with foreign language and unconventional spelling (e.g. l33tsp3ak). In this thesis we explore the performance of authorship attribution methods in adversarial settings where authors take measures to hide their identity by changing their writing style and by creating multiple identities. We show that using a large feature set, it is possible to distinguish regular documents from deceptive documents with high accuracy and present an analysis of linguistic features that can be modified to hide writing style. We show how to adapt regular authorship attribution to difficult datasets such as leaked underground forum and present a method for detecting multiple identities of authors. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a case study that includes applying our technique to an underground forum and manual analysis to validate the results, enabling the discovery of previously undetected multiple accounts.%%%%Ph.D., Computer Science  – Drexel University, 2013","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Adversarial system', 'Identity (music)', 'Writing style', 'Deception', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Handwriting', 'Data science', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology', 'Acoustics', 'Pure mathematics', 'History', 'Programming language']",['Sadia Afroz'],0,False,,[],2,46.098019469620674,5.2619808726995276e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20003683386610888

This article applies stylometry, the computational method of analysing style, to the oeuvres of 10 Dutch and English crosswriters to trace potential differences in their individual style and similarities between the authors. The analyses also take into account the age of the intended reader (as listed in the paratext) and the publication date, to study the influence these aspects have on writing style. Four case studies zoom in on a specific author or age category of the intended readership to study general tendencies as well as outliers. The results from the stylometric analyses are complemented with peritextual information about the author’s view on style and writing for readerships of different ages. The main conclusion drawn from the case studies is that the style of the texts usually correlates more strongly with the age of the intended reader than with the time period in which it was written. Young adult literature clusters more closely with adult literature. The style associated with a younger readership is distinct in the oeuvres of most authors studied in this article and even transcends the differences between authors.","['Stylometry', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Psychology', 'Audience measurement', 'TRACE (psycholinguistics)', 'Writing style', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Advertising', 'Philosophy', 'Business']","['Wouter Haverals', 'Lindsey Geybels', 'Vanessa Joosen']",28,False,Language and Literature International Journal of Stylistics,[],2,42.351795904666,3.946485654524646e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20002762539958166

All texts are personal texts that are collected from volunteers and case documents that are permitted to be accessed. Data analysis was carried out by determining and calculating the n-grams, both on the character-level and word-level, and performing stylometric features that the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library extracts. The results of the data analysis show that lexically, the character-level n-gram analysis, as the smallest n-unit, shows an important element of authorship attribution, such as the use of alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, capitalization, and punctuation. Diction is a significant factor to identify the author's profile and distinguish between one author and another.

Stylometric similarity in literary corpora: Non-authorship clustering and<i>Deutscher Novellenschatz</i>,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqac039,3,"Abstract A distant-reading task in literary corpus analysis is to group stylometrically similar texts. Since there are many ways to define writing style, the result not only depends on the clustering method but even more so on the measure of similarity. With authorship attribution, the predominant application of stylometry, as its benchmark much research has addressed the utility of methods for measuring similarity. We use a corpus of German-language novellas to demonstrate that one may be interested in very different meaningful groups of texts simultaneously, and that these can be recovered from stylometric clustering if the measure is chosen accordingly. As can be expected, different measures do better at recovering groups associated with, for instance, subgenre, author gender, or narrative perspective. As a consequence, it is suggested that corpus analyses should not be based on what is currently considered the most refined measure of stylometric similarity, but rather break down the decisions that yield a specific measure and provide substantively justified arguments for them.","['Stylometry', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Cluster analysis', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Measure (data warehouse)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Novella', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Narrative', 'Similarity measure', 'Task (project management)', 'Benchmark (surveying)', 'Reading (process)', 'Writing style', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Data mining', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Geodesy', 'Economics', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Geography']","['Simon Päpcke', 'Thomas Weitin', 'Katharina Herget', 'Anastasia Glawion', 'Ulrik Brandes']",16,False,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,['Volkswagen Foundation'],2,42.351795904666,3.946485654524646e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20002762539958166
Towards Improving Code Stylometry Analysis in Underground Forums,2021,https://doi.org/10.2478/popets-2022-0007,3,"Abstract Code Stylometry has emerged as a powerful mechanism to identify programmers. While there have been significant advances in the field, existing mechanisms underperform in challenging domains. One such domain is studying the provenance of code shared in underground forums, where code posts tend to have small or incomplete source code fragments. This paper proposes a method designed to deal with the idiosyncrasies of code snippets shared in these forums. Our system fuses a forum-specific learning pipeline with Conformal Prediction to generate predictions with precise confidence levels as a novelty. We see that identifying unreliable code snippets is paramount to generate high-accuracy predictions, and this is a task where traditional learning settings fail. Overall, our method performs as twice as well as the state-of-the-art in a constrained setting with a large number of authors (i.e., 100). When dealing with a smaller number of authors (i.e., 20), it performs at high accuracy (89%). We also evaluate our work on an open-world assumption and see that our method is more effective at retaining samples.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Code (set theory)', 'Novelty', 'Pipeline (software)', 'Source code', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Domain (mathematical analysis)', 'Task (project management)', 'Information retrieval', 'World Wide Web', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Programming language', 'Engineering', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Mathematics', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Systems engineering', 'Pure mathematics']","['Michal Tereszkowski-Kaminski', 'Sergio Pastrana', 'Jorge Blasco', 'Guillermo Suárez‐Tangil']",41,True,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,[],2,42.351795904666,3.946485654524646e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20002762539958166

In digital forensics, finding out the author of a document is a big qestion, identity of the author, their demographic background, and how they are linked to other documents. So major challenges in digital forensic investigation are author identification of message(s) and non-repudiation. In this paper we used Stylometry based human writing feature extraction as a solution for the author identification problem. Stylometry is not only a way of human writing pattern identification but it can also be used for human gender identification. This paper is oriented to highlight some of the ways to manage such problems like anonymous email messages, email abuse and even for the digital forensics.

To counter authorship attribution, researchers have proposed a variety of rule-based and learning-based text obfuscation approaches. However, existing authorship obfuscation approaches do not consider the adversarial threat model. Specifically, they are not evaluated against adversarially trained authorship attributors that are aware of potential obfuscation. To fill this gap, we investigate the problem of adversarial authorship attribution for deobfuscation. We show that adversarially trained authorship attributors are able to degrade the effectiveness of existing obfuscators from 20-30% to 5-10%. We also evaluate the effectiveness of adversarial training when the attributor makes incorrect assumptions about whether and which obfuscator was used. While there is a a clear degradation in attribution accuracy, it is noteworthy that this degradation is still at or above the attribution accuracy of the attributor that is not adversarially trained at all. Our results motivate the need to develop authorship obfuscation approaches that are resistant to deobfuscation.","['Authorship attribution', 'Adversarial system', 'Obfuscation', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Variety (cybernetics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Stylometry', 'Data science', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Wanyue Zhai', 'Jonathan Rusert', 'Zubair Shafiq', 'Padmini Srinivasan']",35,True,Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),[],2,42.351795904666,3.946485654524646e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20002762539958166

The paper shows research dedicated to construction of various structures of input datasets, and combinations of such structures between train and test sets. In the research the influence of different stratification forms on the performance of selected popular classification systems was observed. To minimise the number of influencing factors, a task of authorship attribution was performed as binary classification with balanced classes.

Evaluating Author Attribution on Emirati Tweets,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3016731,2,"Author Attribution (AA) is a critical stylometry problem that tries to deduce the identity of the authors of electronic texts (e-texts) by only examining the texts. AA is essential for enhancing various application domains, such as recommender systems and forensics. Nevertheless, existing techniques in AA have not been assessed with Emirati social media e-texts.

Authorship Attribution in Bangla Literature (AABL) via Transfer Learning using ULMFiT,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3530691,2,"Authorship Attribution is the task of creating an appropriate characterization of text that captures the authors’ writing style to identify the original author of a given piece of text. With increased anonymity on the internet, this task has become increasingly crucial in various security and plagiarism detection fields. Despite significant advancements in other languages such as English, Spanish, and Chinese, Bangla lacks comprehensive research in this field due to its complex linguistic feature and sentence structure. Moreover, existing systems are not scalable with the increasing number of authors, and performance drops with the small number of samples per author. In this paper, we propose the use of Average-Stochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped Long Short-Term Memory (AWD-LSTM) architecture and an effective transfer learning approach that addresses the problem of complex linguistic features extraction and scalability for authorship attribution in Bangla Literature (AABL). We analyze the effect of different tokenization, such as word, sub-word, and character level tokenization, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these tokenizations in the proposed model. Moreover, we introduce the publicly available Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors (BAAD16) containing 17,966 sample texts and 13.4+ million words to solve the standard dataset scarcity problem and release six variations of pre-trained language models for use in any Bangla NLP downstream task. For evaluation, we used our developed BAAD16 dataset as well as other publicly available datasets. Empirically, our proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art models and achieved 99.8% accuracy in the BAAD16 dataset.

Stylometric Anonymity: Is Imitation the Best Strategy?,2015,https://doi.org/10.1109/trustcom.2015.472,1,"Stylometry analysis of given electronic texts can allow for the extraction of information about their authors by analyzing the stylistic choices the authors make to write their texts. Such extracted information could be the identity of suspect authors or their profile attributes such as their gender, age group, ethnicity group, etc. Therefore, when preserving the anonymity of an author is critical, such as that of a whistle blower, it is important to ensure the stylistic anonymity of the conveyed text itself in addition to anonymizing communication channels (e.g. Tor, or the minimization of application fingerprints). Currently, only two stylistic anonymization strategies are known, namely: imitation and obfuscation attacks. A long-term objective is to find automated methods that reliably transform given input texts such that the output texts maximize author anonymity while, reasonably, preserving the semantics of the input texts. Before one proceeds with such long-term objective, it is important to first identify effective strategies that maximize stylistic anonymity. The current state of the literature implies that imitation attacks are better at preserving the anonymity of authors than obfuscation. However, we argue that such evaluations are limited and should not generalize to stylistic anonymity as they were only executed against AA solvers, a closed-set problem. In this study, we extend such evaluations against state-of-the-art AV solvers, an open-set problem. Our results show that imitation attacks degrade the classification accuracy of AV solvers more aggressively than that of AA solvers. We argue that such reduction in accuracy below random chance guessing renders imitation attacks as inferior strategies relative to obfuscation attacks. Furthermore, as we present a general formal notation of stylometry problems, we conjecture that the same observations apply to all stylometry problems (AA, AV, AP, SI).","['Anonymity', 'Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Obfuscation', 'Imitation', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Suspect', 'Identity (music)', 'Term (time)', 'State (computer science)', 'Scheme (mathematics)', 'Computer security', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Algorithm', 'Mathematics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Political science', 'Acoustics', 'Law', 'Programming language']","['Mahmoud Khonji', 'Youssef Iraqi']",14,False,2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA,[],2,30.423967774420944,1.3154952181748819e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.2000092084665272
A Stylometric Analysis of Ljósvetninga saga,2020,https://doi.org/10.33112/gripla.31.1,1,"Ljósvetninga saga is preserved in two primary versions, the A-redaction and C-redaction. These two redactions feature parallel (though not identical) sections as well as a section (chapters 13–18) which is entirely divergent. Scholars and editors have long disagreed over the question of which version of the saga is more internally consistent. Two stylistic studies by Adolfine Erichsen in 1919 and Hallvard Magerøy in 1956 arrived at opposite conclusions: the former preferring the stylistic coherence of the C-redaction and the latter preferring the A-redaction. The conclusions of these scholars reflected opposing stances on the Freeprose-Bookprose origin of the Íslendingasögur. Proponents of the Freeprose school including Knut Liestøl leveraged Erichsen’s stylistic investigation to argue that the divergent section in A-redaction should be considered a genuine oral variant, whereas proponents of the Bookprose school (including the editor of the saga’s Íslenzk fornrit edition, Björn Sigfússon) criticized the oral understanding and instead framed the divergent C-redaction section as a historical novelization of what was originally the A-redaction. The development of stylometry in recent years has provided us with a statistically-robust set of methods to interrogate the style of texts. In this article, the authors revisit the debate and present stylometric evidence to support Erichsen’s conclusion and reject Magerøy’s: the divergent section of the C-redaction has more in common with the parallel chapters and the A-redaction is likely an independent version of the text retold, possibly with recourse to oral tradition.","['Redaction', 'Section (typography)', 'Stylometry', 'CLARITY', 'Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Computer science', 'Mathematics', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Statistics', 'Operating system']","['Michael MacPherson', 'Yoav Tirosh']",11,True,Gripla,[],2,30.423967774420944,1.3154952181748819e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.2000092084665272

On Authorship Attribution of Telugu Text,2016,https://doi.org/10.17485/ijst/2016/v9i35/98735,1,"Background/Objectives: Authorship Attribution is one of the text classification methods. It is useful to find out the author with a given set of text based on author writing style. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Various methods that include Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) have been used to find text patterns that exist within a text based database. The classification of the text patterns is deterministic whereas the authorship attribution to the text is un-deterministic. This paper presents a method that recognize a text pattern by using the authorship features using different phases of processing which include prior processing, extracting the features, feature selection, classifying the features and then finally leading to finding the author. Findings: The task of Authorship Attribution can be imposed to a range of exercises such as Scientific Analysis, Stealing Recognition and Authorship Recognition. Exploration in the part of Authorship Attribution is in view for more than 100 centuries, but the completed consequences were unacceptable. A range of provocations have been referred which include information collections, tokenizing of the content, applying Natural Language Tools, suitability of categorization methods and reorganization of a range of appearance which can discriminate one writer from the other writers. From the prevailing analysis, it can be concluded that the pronounced accruement are individual circumstance scene of situations, since it may not be useful to other consequences of Authorship Attribution associations. From the acquired inputs, it is recognized that the word “unigram” constituent acquired the finest record when assessed with all additional appearances for all classifiers.

Advances in Distant Diplomatics: A Stylometric Approach to Medieval Charters,2021,https://doi.org/10.54103/interfaces-08-10,1,"The quantitative analysis of writing style (stylometry) is becoming an increasingly common research instrument in philology. When it comes to medieval texts, such a methodology might be able to help us disentangle the multiple authorial strata that can often be discerned in them (issuer, dictator, scribe, etc.). To deliver a proof of concept in 'distant diplomatics,' we have turned to a corpus of twelfth-century Latin charters from the Cambrai episcopal chancery. We subjected this collection to an (unsupervised) stylometric modelling procedure, based on lexical frequency extraction and dimension reduction. In the absence of a sizable 'ground truth' for this material, we zoomed in on a specific case study, namely the oeuvre of the previously identified dictator-scribe known as 'RogF/JeanE.' Our results offer additional support for the attribution of a diplomatic oeuvre to this individual and even allow us to enlarge it with additional documents. Our analysis moreover yielded the serendipitous discovery of another, previously unnoticed, oeuvre, which we tentatively attribute to a scribe-dictator 'JeanB.' We conclude that the large-scale stylometric analysis is a promising methodology for digital diplomatics.

An Optimal Feature Set for Stylometry-based Style Change detection at Document and Sentence Level,2022,https://doi.org/10.32628/cseit228617,1,"Writing style change detection models focus on determining the number of authors of documents with or without known authors. Determining the exact number of authors contributing in writing a document particularly when the authors contribute short texts in form of a sentence is still challenging because of the lack of standardized feature sets able to discriminate between the works of authors. Therefore, the task of identifying the best feature set for all the tasks of the writing style change detection is still considered important. This paper sought to determine the best feature set for the writing style change detection tasks; separating documents with several style changes (multi-authorship) from documents without any style changes (single-authorship), and determining the number and location of style changes in the case of multi-authorship. We performed exploratory research on existing stylometric features to determine the best document level and sentence level features. Document level features were extracted and used to separate single authored from multi-authored documents, while sentence level features were used to answer the question of determining the number of style changes To answer this question, we trained a random forest classifier to rank document level features and sentence level features separately, and applied an ablation test on the top 15 sentence level features using k-means clustering algorithm to confirm the effect of these features on model performance. The study found out that the best document level feature set for separating documents with and without style change was provided by an ensemble of features including number of sentence repetitions (num_sentence_repetitions) as the most determinant feature, 5-grams, 4-grams, Special_character, sentence_begin_lower, sentence_begin_upper, diversity, automated_readability_index, parenthesis_count, first_word_uppercase, lensear_write_formula, dale_chall_readability, difficult_words, type_token_ratio","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Sentence', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Writing style', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Programming language']","['Vivian Anyango Oloo', 'Lilian Wanzare', 'Calvins Otieno']",24,True,International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology,[],2,30.423967774420944,1.3154952181748819e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.2000092084665272
Larger than Life? A Stylometric Analysis of the Multi-Authored 'Vita' of Hildegard of Bingen,2021,https://doi.org/10.54103/interfaces-08-08,1,"This article explores by aid of stylometric methods the collaborative authorship of the Vita Hildegardis, Hildegard of Bingen's (auto-?)biography.

In between these termini a quo and ante quem the work was allegedly taken up but left unfinished by secretaries Godfrey of Disibodenberg and Guibert of Gembloux. In light of the fact that the Vita is an indispensable source in gaining historical knowledge on Hildegard's life, the question has often been raised whether the Life of Hildegard is – by dint of contributions by multiple stakeholders – a larger-than-life depiction of the visionary's life course. Specifically the 'autobiographical' passages included in the Vita, in which Hildegard is allegedly cited directly and is taken to recount biographical information in the first-person singular, have been approached with suspicion.

In particular, works by Frances Milton, Frances Eleanor, Thomas Adolphus, and Anthony (referred to collectively as ""the authorial Trollopes""), as well as some works by Charles Dickens, constitute the corpus. Dickens, initially used as a control in the analysis, in actuality emerged either as a potential influence on the authorial Trollopes given his stringent editorial practices, or as being influenced by the Trollopes himself.

Investigating the Linguistic Fingerprint of GPT-4o in Arabic-to-English Translation Using Stylometry,2024,https://doi.org/10.48185/jtls.v5i3.1343,0,"This study explores the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of machine-generated texts, focusing on the output of GPT-4o. Using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including word frequency and stopword count analysis, readability and sentence structure metrics, lexical diversity measures, syntactic frequency analysis, and named entity recognition (NER), the research aims to uncover the stylometric fingerprints present in machine-generated content. The results reveal that GPT-4ogenerated texts exhibit moderate lexical diversity and syntactic complexity, with certain chapters reflecting higher readability and more varied sentence structures, while others lean toward simpler linguistic patterns. The findings also highlight thematic variation across chapters, as observed in the distribution of named entities, which contributes to understanding the model’s handling of different contextual content. The research suggests that while GPT-4o maintains a consistent style in its generated text, there are distinguishable characteristics that may serve as indicators of machine authorship. This provides valuable insights for stylometric analysis, authorship attribution, and the identification of machine-generated texts in various contexts. Future research could extend this work by exploring deeper stylometric features, conducting cross-model comparisons, and developing advanced authorship detection algorithms tailored for AI-generated content.

The author’s fingerprint. A computerised attribution method,2014,,0,"Methods borrowed from Information Theory are applied to the traditional text criticism. A critique of the raw cladistic methods and an interpretation of the dichotomy-phenomenon are offered. The same methods are applied to 13th century Italian poetry to determine authorship attributions and to verify commonly accepted literary taxonomy. Philology is a human science primarily applied to literary texts and traditionally divided into lower and higher criticism. Lower criticism tries to reconstruct the author’s original text and higher criticism is the study of the authorship, style, and provenance of texts. The use of methods borrowed from information theory makes it possible to bring together methodologically some of the sectors of the two fields. The outcome of the experiments in both text criticism and text attribution has been encouraging. In the former, the tests performed on three different traditions have provided results very similar to those obtained by traditional methods requiring a great amount of time. The experiments carried out both on 13th century Italian poets and schools have shown that it is possible to draw texts closer to one another. Furthermore, the method we have used makes it possible to attribute anonymous writings.","['Criticism', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Interpretation (philosophy)', 'Literary criticism', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Philology', 'Stylometry', 'Epistemology', 'Poetry', 'Writing style', 'Literature', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Gender studies', 'Feminism']",['Paolo Canettieri'],0,False,,[],2,13.026854649211145,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.19999999999999998

The words used by certain individuals, distinctive structuring of the sentences, personification of vocabulary, writing discipline and articulation of theory can often be used to link a piece of written work. Authorship attribution is one of the oldest problems in linguistics which also became one of the most important ones to be solved with the rise of modern statistics, machine learning and natural language processing. Authorship attribution is defined as an attempt to identify if the testing corpus has been written by the aforementioned author or not using their stylometric fingerprint. Here the proposed research discusses in detail about solving this challenging problem of identifying patterns in text using multiclass classification techniques coupled with Radial Basis Function. The proposed model yields state-of-the-art performance on several data sets, containing either formal texts written by a closed set of authors or informal texts generated by thousands of online users.

In this context, the current study focuses on author attribution in which the true author of a doubtful text must be identified. This analysis focuses on the style of sixty-six French comedies in verse written by seventeen supposed authors during the 17th century. The hypothesis we want to verify assumes that the real author is the name appearing on the cover (called the signature hypothesis). In order to validate the reliability of two attribution procedures, we used two additional corpora based on 200 extracts of novels written in French, with thirty authors and 140 Italian novels authored by forty persons. After this verification, we propose an improvement of the Delta method as well as a new analysis grid for this model. Finally, we applied these approaches to our French comedy corpus. The results demonstrate that the signature hypothesis must be discarded. Moreover, these works present similar styles, making any attribution difficult to support with a high degree of certainty.","['Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Certainty', 'Computer science', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Stylometry', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Signature (topology)', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Linguistics', 'History', 'Literature', 'Psychology', 'Epistemology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Power (physics)', 'Physics', 'Geometry', 'Archaeology', 'Quantum mechanics']",['Jacques Savoy'],26,False,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,['Hasler Stiftung'],2,13.026854649211145,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.19999999999999998

Our models achieved an F1 score of approximately 0.95 when using the dataset with the comments of the top five users by the number of written comments. Training on datasets that include comments written by an increasing number of people results in models with a gradually decreasing F1 score.

Code stylometry vs formatting and minification,2024,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2142,0,"The automatic identification of code authors based on their programming styles—known as authorship attribution or code stylometry—has become possible in recent years thanks to improvements in machine learning-based techniques for author recognition. Once feasible at scale, code stylometry can be used for well-intended or malevolent activities, including: identifying the most expert coworker on a piece of code (if authorship information goes missing); fingerprinting open source developers to pitch them unsolicited job offers; de-anonymizing developers of illegal software to pursue them. Depending on their respective goals, stakeholders have an interest in making code stylometry either more or less effective. To inform these decisions we investigate how the accuracy of code stylometry is impacted by two common software development activities: code formatting and code minification. We perform code stylometry on Python code from the Google Code Jam dataset (59 authors) using a code2vec-based author classifier on concrete syntax tree (CST) representations of input source files. We conduct the experiment using both CSTs and ASTs (abstract syntax trees). We compare the respective classification accuracies on: (1) the original dataset, (2) the dataset formatted with Black, and (3) the dataset minified with Python Minifier. Our results show that: (1) CST-based stylometry performs better than AST-based (51.00%→68%), (2) code formatting makes a significant dent (15%) in code stylometry accuracy (68%→53%), with minification subtracting a further 3% (68%→50%).

CLOSE AND OPEN TASK AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION: A COMPUTATIONAL AUTHORSHIP ANALYSIS,2019,https://doi.org/10.18860/prdg.v2i1.6704,0,"&lt;p&gt;Authorship analysis is one of the areas lies within forensic linguistics where the main task is to investigate the characteristics of a text in terms of its authorship. Specifically, authorship attribution examines the possibility of an author for having written the text by analyzing the author's other works. This experimental research addresses two problems: which author writes which text (using a closed task authorship attribution) and who writes each text (using an open task of authorship attribution). In doing so, this research uses R to do statistical computing employing both stylo() and classify() functions. Based on carried out experiments with 1-grams as a fixed variable, it is concluded that SVM algorithm may be best used in doing closed task authorship attribution for its 100% consistency, whereas for the open task k-NN algorithm may be best used since it reaches 94% consistency. In addition to open class task, stylo() function may perform better than classify() function since stylo() function provides results closer to the actual answer. As the legal system often challenges authorship analysis for not having a valid methodology, analyzing styles using stylometry and measuring the styles computationally may help forensic linguists to provide an adequate analysis for the legal system.

The finding challenged the long-established view that Copernicus became a humanistically minded scholar early in his life and composed Commentariolus between 1509 and 1514. The present study verifies and extends this investigation by analyzing the whole extant literary oeuvre of Copernicus. The stylometric investigation for the most critical stylistic markers is followed by a detailed linguistic analysis. The results allow for convincing guesses on what motivated Copernicus to abruptly change his Latin style and establish the circumstances under which Copernicus most likely fully embraced Renaissance humanism. In addition, the subsequent historiographical analysis presents a plausible hypothesis on the precise dating of Commentariolus, the “birth certificate” of Copernicus’s geokinetic cosmology.

One cannot identify a writer from a written piece of text on the basis of retina or fingerprint scans, sometimes even the signature can be forged, in such situations for security purposes and intellectual property rights it becomes very important to identify the true author. Stylometry plays an important role in this. Every author has a unique style of writing, measure of this style of writing is called Stylometry. This paper proposes to identify authors from text based on their style of writing. First a data set consisting of articles, short stories and emails will be used to train the system for multiple authors, then a random text would be given to the system to identify the author correctly, if the author predicted by the system is similar to the author claimed then the information is authentic otherwise the author claiming to be the writer is a fraud. For stylometry, over the ages, many features have been focused on, but this paper proposes new features to be used for this purpose. While writing, there are many unconscious styles that are incorporated by the author, these features have been unnoticed till date, but can play a vital role in accurate and fast identification of authors.

Leggett's (1988) model with attribution theory. Three studies tested the hypothesis that theories of intelligence—the belief that intelligence is malleable (incremental theory) versus fixed (entity theory)—would predict (and create) effort versus ability attributions, which would then mediate mastery-oriented coping. Study 1 revealed that, when given negative feedback, incremental theorists were more likely than entity theorists to attribute to effort. Studies 2 and 3 showed that incremental theorists were more likely than entity theorists to take remedial action if performance was unsatisfactory. Study 3, in which an entity or incremental theory was induced, showed that incremental theorists' remedial action was mediated by their effort attributions. These results suggest that implicit theories create the meaning framework in which attributions occur and are important for understanding motivation.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Action (physics)', 'Psychotherapist', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics']","['Ying‐yi Hong', 'Chi‐yue Chiu', 'Carol S.

Depressive attributional style.,1979,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-843x.88.3.242,1080,"Depressed college students, compared to nondepressed college students, attributed bad outcomes to internal, stable, and global causes, as measured by an attributional style scale. This attributional style was predicted by the reformulated helplessness model of depression. In addition, relative to nondepressed students, depressed students attributed good outcomes to external, unstable causes. Recently, Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale (1978) proposed an attributional reformulation of the learned helplessness hypothesis. This reformulation resolves a number of the inadequacies of the original hypothesis when applied to human helplessness and depression. According to the reformulated hypothesis, the kinds of causal attributions people make for lack of control influence whether their helplessness will entail low selfesteem and whether their helplessness will generalize across situations and time. Abramson et al. argued that three attributional dimensions are crucial for explaining human helplessness and depression: internal-external, stable-unstable, and global-specific. In brief, the reformulated model asserts that attributing lack of control to internal factors leads to lowered self-esteem, whereas attributing lack of control to external factors does not. Furthermore, attributing lack of control to stable factors should lead to helplessness deficits extended across time, and attributing lack of control to global factors should lead to wide generalization of help","['Learned helplessness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Generalization', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Control (management)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Depression (economics)', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Management', 'Macroeconomics', 'Economics']","['Martin E.

Corporate Attributions as Strategic Illusions of Management Control,1984,https://doi.org/10.2307/2393176,709,"Gerald R. Salancik and James R. Meindl This paper examines the reasons given by CEOs to explain their firms' performance in annual stockholder reports over an 18-year period, comparing firms with stable and unstable performance. We argue that the managements of unstable firms, lacking real control over organizational outcomes, strategically manipulate causal attributions to manage impressions of their control. As evidence of this, these managements claim responsibility for both positive and negative outcomes more than do the managements of firms with stable performance, and, contrary to psychological theories, seem reluctant to attribute poor performance to uncontrollable environmental events. When environmental effects are cited, they are coupled with announcements of executive changes, thus implying to readers that management is taking steps to wrestle with its unruly environment. Evidence also indicates that these attributional strategies resulted in better future performance for the firms employing them.","['Attribution', 'Illusion', 'Illusion of control', 'Strategic management', 'Management control system', 'Control (management)', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Management', 'Process management', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Marketing', 'Economics']","['Gerald R.

Videotape and the attribution process: Reversing actors' and observers' points of view.,1973,https://doi.org/10.1037/h0034782,678,"Two actor subjects at a time engaged in a brief, unstructured conversation while two observer subjects looked on. Later a questionnaire measured the actors' attributions of their own behavior in the conversation either to dispcsitional, internal causes or to situational, external causes. Similarly, each observer attributed his matched actor's behavior. Videotapes of the conversation, replayed to subjects before the attribution questionnaire, provided an experimental manipulation of visual orientation. Some actors and observers saw no videotape replay, while other subjects saw a tape that merely repeated their original visual orientations. As predicted for both of these conditions, the actors attributed relatively more to the situation than the observers. A third set of subjects saw a videotape taken from a new perspective—some actors saw a tape of themselves, while some observers saw the other participant with whom their matched actor had been conversing. With this reorientation, self-viewing actors attributed relatively more to their own dispositions than observers. The results indicated the importance of visual orientation in determining attributional differences between actors and observers. Pragmatically, the theoretical framework and results of the study had relevance to the use of videotape self-observation in therapy and T groups. When an individual observes a behavior and attempts to understand its causes, he is concerned with the relative importance of personal dispositions of the actor and the surrounding social and environmental context. Both an observer who wishes to explain another's behavior and an actor who tries to understand his own behavior attempt to make the appropriate causal attributions. There is reason to believe, however, that actors and observers do not always arrive at the same explanation of the actor's behavior.

For negative events, attributions to internal, stable, and global causes had a reliable and significant association with depression. Studies in which the attribution factors of ability and luck were measured also showed a reliable association with depression. For positive events, attributions to external, unstable, and specific causes were associated with depression. Ability and luck attribution factors for positive events were also associated with depression. The relations for positive events, however, were weaker than the corresponding ones for negative events. In general, these patterns of relations were independent of a number of potential mediators suggested by authors in this literature, including the type of subject studied (psychiatric vs. college student), the type of event about which the attribution is made (real vs. simulated), the depression measure used, or the publication status of the research report.

"Peer and cyber aggression in secondary school students: the role of moral disengagement, hostile attribution bias, and outcome expectancies",2009,https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.20336,508,"This study investigated the relationship between cognitive mechanisms, applied by people to rationalize and justify harmful acts, and engagement in traditional peer and cyber aggression among school children. We examined the contribution of moral disengagement (MD), hostile attribution bias, and outcome expectancies, and we further explored the individual contribution of each MD mechanism. Our aim was to identify shared and unique cognitive factors of the two forms of aggression. Three hundred and thirty-nine secondary school children completed self-report measures that assessed MD, hostile attribution bias, outcome expectancies, and their roles and involvement in traditional and cyber aggression. We found that the MD total score positively related to both forms of peer-directed aggression. Furthermore, traditional peer aggression positively related to children's moral justification, euphemistic language, displacement of responsibility and outcome expectancies, and negatively associated with hostile attribution bias. Moral justification also related positively to cyber aggression. Cyber aggression and cyber victimization were associated with high levels of traditional peer aggression and victimization, respectively. The results suggest that MD is a common feature of both traditional and cyber peer aggression, but it seems that traditional forms of aggression demand a higher level of rationalization or justification. Moreover, the data suggest that the expectation of positive outcomes from harmful behavior facilitates engagement in traditional peer aggression. The differential contribution of specific cognitive mechanisms indicates the need for future research to elaborate on the current findings, in order to advance theory and inform existing and future school interventions tackling aggression and bullying.","['Aggression', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Attribution bias', 'Moral disengagement', 'Developmental psychology', 'Poison control', 'Social psychology', 'Peer victimization', 'Psychological intervention', 'Cognition', 'Suicide prevention', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Environmental health']","['Chrisa D.

This research program has been built on the fundamental idea that, although old‐fashioned, overt forms of racism have lost much of their appeal in American politics, new, more subtle and symbolic forms of racism continue to exert a pervasive influence on policy debates, making themselves felt, for example, in opposition to busing, to affirmative action, or even to black candidates running for office. This paper identifies serious empirical, logical, and methodological shortcomings in the case that researchers have advanced to support the symbolic racism thesis.

A fundamental attribution error? Rethinking cognitive distortions<sup>†</sup>,2006,https://doi.org/10.1348/135532506x114608,427,"The notion of ‘cognitive distortion’ has become enshrined in the offender treatment literature over the last 20 years, yet the concept still suffers from a lack of definitional clarity. In particular, the umbrella term is often used to refer to offence‐supportive attitudes, cognitive processing during an offence sequence, as well as post‐hoc neutralisations or excuses for offending. Of these very different processes, the last one might be the most popular and problematic. Treatment programmes for offenders often aim to eliminate excuse‐making as a primary aim, and decision‐makers place great weight on the degree to which an offender “takes responsibility” for his or her offending. Yet, the relationship between these after‐the‐fact explanations and future crime is not at all clear. Indeed, the designation of post hoc excuses as criminogenic may itself be an example of fallacious thinking. After all, outside of the criminal context, post hoc excuse‐making is widely viewed as normal, healthy, and socially rewarded behaviour. We argue that the open exploration of contextual risk factors leading to offending can help in the identification of criminogenic factors as well as strengthen the therapeutic experience. Rather than insist that offenders take “responsibility” for the past, we suggest that efforts should focus on helping them take responsibility for the future, shifting the therapeutic focus from post hoc excuses to offence‐supportive attitudes and underlying cognitive schemas that are empirically linked to re‐offending.","['Excuse', 'Psychology', 'CLARITY', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Cognition', 'Attribution', 'Social psychology', 'Criminology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Psychiatry', 'Paleontology', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Biology']","['Shadd Maruna', 'Ruth E.

Cross sectional study of symptom attribution and recognition of depression and anxiety in primary care Commentary: There must be limits to the medicalisation of human distress,1999,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7181.436,389,"# Cross sectional study of symptom attribution and recognition of depression and anxiety in primary care {#article-title-2} Objectives : To examine the effect of patients' causal attributions of common somatic symptoms on recognition by general practitioners of cases of depression and anxiety and to test the hypothesis that normalising attributions make recognition less likely. Design : Cross sectional survey. Setting : One general practice of eight doctors in Bristol. Subjects : 305 general practice attenders. Main outcome measure : The rate of detection by general practitioners of cases of depression and anxiety as defined by the general health questionnaire. Results : Consecutive attenders completed the general health questionnaire and the symptom interpretation questionnaire, which scores style of symptom attribution along the dimensions of psychologising, somatising, and normalising. General practitioners detected depression or anxiety in 56 (36%; 95% confidence interval 28% to 44%) of the 157 patients who scored highly on the general health questionnaire. Subjects with a normalising attributional style were less likely to be detected as cases; doctors did not make any psychological diagnosis in 46 (85%; 73% to 93%) of 54 patients who had high questionnaire and high normalising scores. Those with a psychologising style were more likely to be detected; doctors did not detect 21 (38%; 25% to 52%) of 55 patients who had high questionnaire and high psychologising scores. The somatisation scale was not associated with low detection rates. This pattern of results persisted after adjustment for age, sex, general health questionnaire score, and general practitioner. Conclusions : Normalising attributions minimise symptoms and are non-pathological in character. The normalising attributional style is predominant in general practice attenders and is an important cause of low rates of detection of depression and anxiety. # Commentary: There must be limits to the medicalisa","['Attribution', 'Anxiety', 'General Health Questionnaire', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Mental health', 'General practice', 'Distress', 'Medicine', 'Psychology', 'Patient Health Questionnaire', 'Family medicine', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['David Keßler', 'Keith Lloyd', 'Glyn Lewis', 'Denis Pereira Gray', 'Iona Heath']",26,True,BMJ,[],1,98.82040953340046,0.005117276398700291,0.3333333333333333,0.1035820934790902

This paper describes a study examining the relationship between attributional processes and ToM deficits. Seventy‐seven undergraduate participants completed a ToM task and forty‐six also completed the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ).

This paper formulates an attributional theory intended primarily to explain social status effects, although other applications are possible. The point of departure for this model is the socializing influence of SES on causal attribution tendencies (i.e., fatalism) and the resulting variation in vulnerability to psychological disorder. Data from two panel studies suggest that causal attribution styles could in fact play a central role in the mediation of social causation of disorder. Comparisons of two contrasting versions of the attributional model show that a simple, linear interpretation of the intervening effects offatalism may be the most adequate.

Clarity was positively associated with measures of positive well-being and negatively associated with measures of negative well-being. Individuals who experience intense emotions (Intensity), who attend to them often (Attention), or who notably express them (Expression), reported coping by focusing on and venting their emotions and by seeking social support.

This paper examines Lazarus' transactional appraisal approach and includes a specific discussion of the process by which employees' attributions regarding stressors and the resulting emotions significantly influence their choices of coping mechanisms. Given that a single work event can be interpreted in a variety of ways, the role of individuals' cognitive processing is being ignored by much of the current empirical stress research.

"Detecting Hoaxes, Frauds, and Deception in Writing Style Online",2012,https://doi.org/10.1109/sp.2012.34,301,"In digital forensics, questions often arise about the authors of documents: their identity, demographic background, and whether they can be linked to other documents. The field of stylometry uses linguistic features and machine learning techniques to answer these questions. While stylometry techniques can identify authors with high accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios, their accuracy is reduced to random guessing when faced with authors who intentionally obfuscate their writing style or attempt to imitate that of another author. While these results are good for privacy, they raise concerns about fraud. We argue that some linguistic features change when people hide their writing style and by identifying those features, stylistic deception can be recognized. The major contribution of this work is a method for detecting stylistic deception in written documents. We show that using a large feature set, it is possible to distinguish regular documents from deceptive documents with 96.6% accuracy (F-measure). We also present an analysis of linguistic features that can be modified to hide writing style.","['Stylometry', 'Deception', 'Computer science', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Writing style', 'Identity (music)', 'Adversarial system', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Natural language processing', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology', 'Acoustics', 'Pure mathematics', 'History', 'Programming language']","['Sadia Afroz', 'Michael Brennan', 'Rachel Greenstadt']",32,False,IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,[],1,98.28734474655924,0.003959640606706395,0.3333333333333333,0.10277174842469447

This study examines the influence of psychological entitlement on workplace outcomes, using attribution theory to explain its effects. Results suggested that entitlement perceptions are positively associated with self‐serving attribution styles and that diminished need for cognition mediates this relationship. Self‐serving attribution styles, in turn, were associated with reduced job satisfaction and increased levels of conflict with supervisors. A direct positive relationship between psychological entitlement and turnover intent was also observed. Overall, results suggest that an attributional perspective is useful in explaining and understanding the influence of entitlement perceptions on workplace outcomes.

"""Difficult"" Children as Elicitors and Targets of Adult Communication Patterns: An Attributional-Behavioral Transactional Analysis",1984,https://doi.org/10.2307/1165910,257,"A transactional model of adult-child interaction was proposed and tested. In determining the effects that caregivers and children have on each other, it was maintained that adult attributions act as important moderators in the interaction process. Specifically, it was predicted that adult beliefs about the causes of caregiving outcomes act as selective filters or sensitizers to child behavior--determining the nature and amount of adult reaction to different child behaviors. It was further predicted that adult attributions act in a self-fulfilling fashion, that is, the communication patterns that follow from caregiver beliefs act to elicit child behavior patterns that maintain those beliefs. In a synthetic family strategy, elementary-school-aged boys were paired with unrelated mothers (N = 96) for videotaped interactions. Children were either trained or preselected on two orthogonal dimensions: responsiveness and assertiveness. Mothers were premeasured on their self-perceived power as caregivers (S+) and the social power they attributed to children (C+). Videotapes were analyzed separately for adult facial expression and posture, voice intonation, and verbal communication. Each of these behavioral dimensions was measured on the dimensions of affect, assertion, and ""maternal quality"" (e.g., baby-talk). We expected low self-perceived power to sensitize the adult to variations in child responsiveness and high child-attributed power to sensitize the adult to variations in child assertiveness. Two transactional sequences were obtained (the same patterns were obtained for acted and dispositional enactments of child behavior): 1. Low S+ mothers (in comparison with high S+ mothers) were selectively reactive to child unresponsiveness. These adults reacted to unresponsive children with a communication pattern characterized by a ""maternal"" quality, negative affect, and positive affect that was unassertively inflected.

Attributions and communication in roommate conflicts,1980,https://doi.org/10.1080/03637758009376031,247,"Abstract This paper develops a theoretical approach to communication in interpersonal conflict which emphasizes the role of attributional processes. According to this view, communicative decisions in conflict are largely a function of social attributions about the intent, causality, and stability of behaviors in conflict. Factors which bias attributions along these dimensions encourage noncooperative conflict stategies. Predictions from this perspective were examined in a field study of college dormitory roommates.

“<i>They</i> Did It”: The Effects of Emotionalized Blame Attribution in Populist Communication,2016,https://doi.org/10.1177/0093650216644026,247,"How can we explain the persuasiveness of populist messages, and who are most susceptible to their effects? These questions remain largely unanswered in extant research. This study argues that populist messages are characterized by assigning blame to elites in an emotionalized way. As previous research pointed at the guiding influence of blame attributions and emotions on political attitudes, these message characteristics may explain populism’s persuasiveness. An experiment using a national sample ( N = 721) was conducted to provide insights into the effects of and mechanisms underlying populist blame attribution with regard to the European and national levels of governance. The results show that emotionalized blame attributions influence both blame perceptions and populist attitudes. Identity attachment moderates these effects: Emotionalized blame attributions have the strongest effects for citizens with weaker identity attachments. These insights allow us to understand how populist messages affect which citizens.","['Blame', 'Attribution', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Populism', 'Extant taxon', 'Politics', 'Perception', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Sample (material)', 'Political science', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Chromatography', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Neuroscience', 'Law', 'Biology']","['Michael Hameleers', 'L.

This model predicts that depressives who have an enhancing attributional style for positive events (i.e., make global, stable attributions for such events) will be more likely to regain hopefulness and, thereby, recover from depression, when positive events occur. This prediction was tested by following a group of depressed college students longitudinally for 6 weeks. Although neither positive events alone nor attributional style alone predicted reduction in hopelessness, depressives who both showed the enhancing attributional style for positive events and experienced more positive events showed dramatic reductions in hopelessness which were accompanied by remission of depressive symptoms. Thus, attributional style for positive events may be a factor that enables some depressives to recover when positive events occur in their lives.","['Hopefulness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Depression (economics)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Cognition', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Douglas J.

Using an abstract experiment and a survey of experienced financial managers, we provide evidence that managerial overconfidence may also contribute to this decision. Our experiment shows that participants engage in self‐serving attribution, giving greater weight to internal than external factors as explanations for good performance. This increases confidence in improved future performance, which increases their willingness to issue forecasts. Two facets of the stable individual trait overconfidence, dispositional optimism and miscalibration, also contribute to confidence in improved future performance and willingness to issue forecasts. Consistent with these results, experienced financial manager survey participants believe other managers are likely to overestimate the extent to which they contribute to positive firm performance, and both overoptimism about firm performance and overconfidence in their ability to predict future firm performance contribute to issuance of earnings forecasts.","['Overconfidence effect', 'Optimism', 'Earnings', 'Trait', 'Attribution', 'Actuarial science', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Economics', 'Accounting', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['Robert Libby', 'Kristina M.

Attributional styles and life events in the classroom: Vulnerability and invulnerability to depressive mood reactions.,1982,https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.43.3.612,244,"A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with the same negative life event, people who display a generalized tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors. We tested this prediction with a prospective design in a naturalistic setting by determining whether the content of college students' attributional styles at one point in time predicted the severity of their depressive mood response to receiving a low grade on a midterm exam at a subsequent point in time. Consistent with the prediction, students with an internal or global attributional style for negative outcomes at Time 1 experienced a depressive mood response when confronted with a subsequent low midterm grade, whereas students with an external or specific attributional style for negative outcomes were invulnerable to this depressive mood response. In contrast to the results for the internality and globality dimensions, students' scores along the stability attribution dimension were not correlated with the severity of their depressive mood response to the low midterm grade. In the absence of a negative life event (i.e., receipt of a high midterm grade), students' generalized tendencies to make internal or global attributions for negative outcomes at Time 1 were not significantly correlated with their subsequent changes in depressive mood although there was a nonsignificant positive correlation between severity of depressive mood response and the tendency to make global attributions for negative outcomes at Time 1.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Learned helplessness', 'Mood', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive vulnerability', 'Association (psychology)', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Experience sampling method', 'Depression (economics)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapist', 'Anxiety', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Gerald I.

"Empowerment, attribution and apologising as dimensions of service recovery",1998,https://doi.org/10.1108/09564239810199932,238,"The production of most services depends heavily on human involvement which, by definition, implies variability. The difficulty of standardising human behaviour during service delivery at a level expected by customers is exacerbated by the simultaneity of production and consumption. When service failures occur, the presence of customers leaves little scope for corrective action without the customer being aware of the mishap. The difficulty in avoiding visible service failures does not have to result in dissatisfied customers, however. Service firms can go a long way towards turning dissatisfied customers who have had a negative service experience into ones who are likely to remain loyal to the firm. That, however, requires an effective service recovery programme. This study pursued two objectives. The empirical results show that attribution (the firm accepting blame) is, relatively speaking, the dimension most important to customers in their assessment of the service recovery effort, followed by empowerment and apology. Once a service failure has occurred, customers prefer to deal with staff who are empowered to solve their problem quickly and they do not want to hear that someone else is to blame. An apology in person or, alternatively, by telephone is preferable. Surprisingly, pre‐service failure perceptions do not influence the customer’s satisfaction with the recovery effort, suggesting that service recovery is situation‐specific.","['Service recovery', 'Service guarantee', 'Marketing', 'Blame', 'Business', 'Service (business)', 'Empowerment', 'Service level objective', 'Service delivery framework', 'Service design', 'Production (economics)', 'Service quality', 'Economics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Economic growth', 'Macroeconomics']","['Christo Boshoff', 'Jason Leong']",63,False,International Journal of Service Industry Management,[],1,97.60624370594158,0.003130878619256219,0.3333333333333333,0.10219161503347934

Attributional style and the generality of learned helplessness.,1984,https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.46.3.681,223,"According to the logic of the attribution reformulation of learned helplessness, the interaction of two factors influences whether helplessness experienced in one situation will transfer to a new situation. The model predicts that people who exhibit a style of attributing negative outcomes to global factors will show helplessness deficits in new situations that are either similar or dissimilar to the original situation in which they were helpless. In contrast, people who exhibit a style of attributing negative outcomes to only specific factors will show helplessness deficits in situations that are similar, but not dissimilar, to the original situation in which they were helpless. To test these predictions, we conducted two studies in which undergraduates with either a global or specific attributional style for negative outcomes were given one of three pretreatments in the typical helplessness triadic design: controllable bursts of noise, uncontrollable bursts of noise, or no noise. In Experiment 1, students were tested for helplessness deficits in a test situation similar to the pretreatment setting, whereas in Experiment 2, they were tested in a test situation dissimilar to the pretreatment setting. The findings were consistent with predictions of the reformulated helplessness theory.","['Learned helplessness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Generality', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social psychology', 'Test (biology)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Paleontology', 'Archaeology', 'Biology', 'History']","['Lauren B.

Authorship Attribution for Social Media Forensics,2016,https://doi.org/10.1109/tifs.2016.2603960,222,"The veil of anonymity provided by smartphones with pre-paid SIM cards, public Wi-Fi hotspots, and distributed networks like Tor has drastically complicated the task of identifying users of social media during forensic investigations. In some cases, the text of a single posted message will be the only clue to an author's identity. How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field. We argue that there is a significant need in forensics for new authorship attribution algorithms that can exploit context, can process multi-modal data, and are tolerant to incomplete knowledge of the space of all possible authors at training time.","['Computer science', 'Exploit', 'Scalability', 'Social media', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Anonymity', 'Task (project management)', 'Attribution', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Data science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Identity (music)', 'Process (computing)', 'Digital forensics', 'World Wide Web', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer security', 'Operating system', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Management', 'Database', 'Acoustics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Anderson Rocha', 'Walter J.

Mood-Related Persuasion Depends on (Mis)Attributions,1994,https://doi.org/10.1521/soco.1994.12.4.309,221,"Previous research has shown that respondents in sad moods are likely to elaborate persuasive messages and to be highly persuaded by strong but not weak arguments. In contrast, respondents in happy moods are less likely to elaborate persuasive messages and hence show equal, moderate, persuasion by both strong and weak arguments. To examine how mood-related persuasion effects might be moderated by attributions concerning the source of a person's mood, students were approached on days with either pleasant or unpleasant weather and were asked to participate in a survey relating to higher education. Participants either were or were not cued to the weather as a source of their mood. They listened to either strong or weak arguments supporting the implementation of comprehensive examinations for graduating students. Attitudes toward comprehensive exams were measured. Participants reported more positive moods on pleasant days than on unpleasant days. When the weather was not made salient, weather (i.e., mood) interacted with argument strength: When weather was unpleasant, argument strength had an effect on attitudes, but when weather was pleasant, argument strength had no effect. In contrast, when participants were cued to the weather, there were no weather effects on persuasion; instead, attitudes were affected only by argument strength. Implications, mechanisms, and directions for future research are discussed.","['Persuasion', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Mood', 'Argument (complex analysis)', 'Social psychology', 'Cued speech', 'Contrast (vision)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science']","['Robert C.

Consistent with the cross-cultural research, attributions were less dispositional in the East than in the West. This cultural difference was weaker in editorials than in sports articles.

The central goal of this study was to explore how childrearing contexts might moderate relations between parenting styles and mothers' parental beliefs and emotional responses. Design. Participants were 76 mothers of children (41 boys, 35 girls) ranging in age from 30 to 70 months. Mothers completed a global measure of parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative). Self-reports of parental beliefs (parental goals, attributions) and emotional responses (angry, embarrassed, happy) were assessed in response to hypothetical vignettes depicting a variety of children's behaviors (aggression, misbehavior, shyness, prosocial behavior). Results. In situations depicting children's negative behaviors, authoritarian mothers were less focused on empathic goals and attributed child aggression and misbehaviors to less external sources than their more authoritative counterparts. Authoritarian mothers were also more likely to respond with greater anger and embarrassment across all childrearing scenarios. Conclusions. Results suggest that authoritarian and authoritative mothers differ in their affective response patterns consistently across childrearing contexts, but that more challenging childrearing situations accentuate differences in the cognitive reactions of authoritative versus authoritarian mothers. Implications for understanding how general parenting styles may be translated into specific parental responses are considered.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Authoritarianism', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Parenting styles', 'Political science', 'Politics', 'Law', 'Democracy']","['Robert J.

Participants (80 children and 57 adolescents) were seen within 8 weeks of discovery of the abuse and 1 year later. They described why they believed the abuse happened, rated the extent to which internal and external attributions for the abuse event applied to them, and completed measures of general attribution style for everyday events, shame for the abuse, and symptoms of depression, PTSD, and self-esteem. Parents and teachers rated behavior problems. Abuse-specific internal attributions were consistently related to higher levels of psychopathology and were particularly important for predicting PTSD symptoms and parent and teacher reports of internalizing behavior problems, even after controlling for age, gender, abuse events, and general attributional style. Shame also was an important predictor of symptom level and mediated the relation between abuse-specific internal attributions and PTSD symptoms.","['Shame', 'Attribution', 'Sexual abuse', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychology', 'Psychological abuse', 'Clinical psychology', 'Distress', 'Physical abuse', 'Poison control', 'Psychiatry', 'Suicide prevention', 'Medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Medical emergency']","['Candice Feiring', 'Lynn S.

Attributions and adjustment were assessed in a sample of adult female rape victims seen at a hospital-based rape crisis program. Many victims blamed themselves but tended to place more blame on external factors. The pattern of relations between behavioral and characterological self-blame and other attributional measures did not support the hypothesized distinctions between them. Both kinds of self-blame were significantly associated with increased post-rape depression (all ps less than .05).

Analyzing archival data, we found that men's ideas are evaluated as more ingenious than women's ideas (Study 3) and that female executives are stereotyped as less innovative than their male counterparts when evaluated by their supervisors (Study 4). Finally, we observed that stereotypically masculine behavior enhances a man's perceived creativity, whereas identical behavior does not enhance a woman's perceived creativity (Study 5).

Detection and attribution of climate extremes in the observed record,2016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2016.01.001,198,"We present an overview of practices and challenges related to the detection and attribution of observed changes in climate extremes. Detection is the identification of a statistically significant change in the extreme values of a climate variable over some period of time. Issues in detection discussed include data quality, coverage, and completeness. Attribution takes that detection of a change and uses climate model simulations to evaluate whether a cause can be assigned to that change. Additionally, we discuss a newer field of attribution, event attribution, where individual extreme events are analyzed for the express purpose of assigning some measure of whether that event was directly influenced by anthropogenic forcing of the climate system.","['Attribution', 'Climate change', 'Forcing (mathematics)', 'Event (particle physics)', 'Identification (biology)', 'Computer science', 'Climatology', 'Environmental science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Botany', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Geology', 'Ecology', 'Biology']","['David R.

Summit: Scaling Deep Learning Interpretability by Visualizing Activation and Attribution Summarizations,2019,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934659,198,"Deep learning is increasingly used in decision-making tasks. However, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or neurons. As predictions are often computed from millions of weights that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger picture. We present Summit, an interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design. The Summit visualization runs in modern web browsers and is open-sourced.","['Computer science', 'Summit', 'Interpretability', 'Deep learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Visualization', 'Machine learning', 'Artificial neural network', 'Automatic summarization', 'Data visualization', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Data science', 'Cartography', 'Geography']","['Fred Hohman', 'Haekyu Park', 'Caleb Robinson', 'Duen Horng Chau']",59,False,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,[],1,96.89694528365223,0.002604680531986266,0.3333333333333333,0.10182327637239037

Cognitive processes in auditory hallucinations: attributional biases and metacognition,1998,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291798007314,193,"Cognitive models suggest that auditory hallucinations are experienced when mental events are misattributed to an external source; therefore, this study was designed to examine attributional biases in patients experiencing auditory hallucinations. The study also examined the role of metacognitive beliefs in the experience of auditory hallucinations, as some theories have implicated metacognition in the development and maintenance of auditory hallucinations.Fifteen participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experiencing auditory hallucinations were compared with 15 non-hallucinating schizophrenics and 15 non-psychiatric control subjects on several measures, including an immediate source monitoring task and a questionnaire assessing metacognitive beliefs.Results indicated that patients experiencing hallucinations exhibited the predicted bias towards misattributing internal events to an external source, as measured by ratings of internality of responses in a word association task. All groups had lower perceived levels of internality and control for emotionally salient words, which provides further evidence for the importance of emotional content in hallucinations. Patients experiencing hallucinations were found to score higher than the other two groups on metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability and danger and positive beliefs about worry. In addition, a logistic regression analysis showed that beliefs about uncontrollability and danger were predictive of whether subjects experienced auditory hallucinations or not.These results offer considerable support to cognitive bias models of auditory hallucinations, particularly those that implicate metacognition.","['Psychology', 'Auditory hallucination', 'Metacognition', 'Worry', 'Cognition', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Hallucinating', 'Psychosis', 'Attribution bias', 'Audiology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Medicine', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science']","['Caroline A.

Consistency of children's attributions across situations was moderately high at all ages. The cross-sectional structure of AS changed with age, as stability became a more salient aspect of AS than internality and globality. The structure of AS also changed, becoming more traitlike as children grew older. In longitudinal analyses, evidence of a Cognitive Diathesis x Stress interaction did not emerge until Grades 8 and 9, suggesting that AS may not serve as a diathesis for depression at younger ages.

Authorship attribution, small samples, big problem",2013,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqt066,176,"The aim of this study is to find such a minimal size of text samples for authorship attribution that would provide stable results independent of random noise. A few controlled tests for different sample lengths, languages, and genres are discussed and compared. Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size. Although the tests have been performed using the Delta method (Burrows, J.F. (2002). ‘Delta’: a measure of stylistic difference and a guide to likely authorship. Literary and Linguistic Computing, 17(3): 267–87) applied to the most frequent words, some additional experiments have been conducted for support vector machines and k-NN applied to most frequent words, character 3-grams, character 4-grams, and parts-of-speech-tag 3-grams.

Understanding and explaining Delta measures for authorship attribution,2017,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqx023,175,"This article builds on a mathematical explanation of one the most prominent stylometric measures, Burrows's Delta (and its variants), to understand and explain its working. Starting with the conceptual separation between feature selection, feature scaling, and distance measures, we have designed a series of controlled experiments in which we used the kind of feature scaling (various types of standardization and normalization) and the type of distance measures (notably Manhattan, Euclidean, and Cosine) as independent variables and the correct authorship attributions as the dependent variable indicative of the performance of each of the methods proposed. In this way, we are able to describe in some detail how each of these two variables interact with each other and how they influence the results. Thus we can show that feature vector normalization, that is, the transformation of the feature vectors to a uniform length of 1 (implicit in the cosine measure), is the decisive factor for the improvement of Delta proposed recently. We are also able to show that the information particularly relevant to the identification of the author of a text lies in the profile of deviation across the most frequent words rather than in the extent of the deviation or in the deviation of specific words only.","['Normalization (sociology)', 'Scaling', 'Euclidean distance', 'Mathematics', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Feature vector', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Variable (mathematics)', 'Standard deviation', 'Euclidean geometry', 'Transformation (genetics)', 'Statistics', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Geometry', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Anthropology', 'Gene']","['Stefan Evert', 'Fotis Jannidis', 'Thomas Proisl', 'Isabella Reger', 'Steffen Pielström', 'Christof Schöch', 'Thorsten Vitt']",21,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],1,96.35649546827794,0.0023021166318060436,0.3333333333333333,0.10161148164226422

Clerkship directors recognized students' struggles with roles and responsibilities, performing clinical skills, and adjusting to clinical cultures, but they also focused on students' difficulties applying knowledge to clinical reasoning and engaging in self-directed learning.Clerkship directors and students recognize many challenges associated with learning and performing in the clerkships. Students' perspectives suggest that these challenges may be more complex than clerkship directors and clinical teachers realize and/or are capable of addressing.

The Social Impact of Self-Effacing Attributions: The chinese Case,1982,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.1982.9922794,172,"Summary It is argued that a person in Chinese societies who makes self-effacing attributions for his performance should be better liked because his self-effacing attributions support norms whose function is to maintain harmonious interpersonal relationships. To test this hypothesis, Chinese Ss (N = 56) in the experiment watched two confederates (Cs) working on an intellectual task. These Cs were either competent or incompetent and subsequently made either self-effacing or self-enhancing attributions for their performance. Ss then rated them on 12 seven-point bipolar scales tapping likability, competence, and anxiety. Results indicated that a self-effacing C was better liked but rated as less competent than a self-enhancing C. Though in the United States competent persons are better liked, such a finding was not replicated in the present study. Consistent with a self-presentational analysis, incompetent performers who made self-enhancing attributions were perceived as more anxious than performers in the other conditions. The role of culture in producing the attribution results for likability and competence was analyzed.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Michael Harris Bond', 'Kwok Leung', 'Kwok‐Choi Wan']",30,False,The Journal of Social Psychology,[],1,96.27358173883853,0.002262651775260797,0.3333333333333333,0.10158385624268255

Participants were asked to identify a likely cause of the behaviour and then on a Likert-type scale rate attributions of internality, stability, globality and controllability. In addition they recorded their level of sympathy with the patient and their optimism for change.Patients with a label of BPD attracted more negative responses from staff than those with a label of schizophrenia or depression. Causes of their negative behaviour were rated as more stable and they were thought to be more in control of the causes of the behaviour and the behaviour itself. Staff reported less sympathy and optimism towards patients with a diagnosis of BPD and rated their personal experiences as more negative than their experiences of working with patients with a diagnosis of depression or schizophrenia.Staff regard patients with a BPD label to be more in control of negative behaviour than patients with a label of schizophrenia or depression. In accord with Weiner's (1985) model, attributions of control were inversely related to staff sympathy.

When Does Charisma Matter for Top-Level Leaders? Effect of Attributional Ambiguity,2014,https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2012.0831,164,"One stream of leadership theory suggests that leaders are evaluated via inferential observer processes that compare the fit of the target to a prototype of an ideal (charismatic) leader. Alternatively, attributional theories of leadership suggest that evaluations depend on knowledge of past organizational performance, which is attributed to the leader’s skills. We develop a novel theory showing how inferential and attributional processes simultaneously explain top-level leader evaluation, and, ultimately, leader retention and selection. We argue that observers will mostly rely on attributional mechanisms when performance signals clearly indicate good or poor performance outcomes. However, under conditions of attributional ambiguity (i.e., when performance signals are unclear), observers will mostly rely on inferential processes. In Study 1, we tested our theory in an unconventional context—U.S. presidential elections—and found that the two processes, due to the leader’s charisma and country’s economic performance, interact in predicting whether a leader is selected. Using a business context and an experimental design, in Study 2, we showed that CEO charisma and firm performance interact in predicting leader retention, confirming the results we found in Study 1. Thus, our results suggest that this phenomenon is quite general and can apply to various performance domains.","['Charisma', 'Ambiguity', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Charismatic authority', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Presidential system', 'Attribution', 'Transformational leadership', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Computer science', 'Political science', 'Paleontology', 'Politics', 'Law', 'Biology', 'Programming language']","['Philippe Jacquart', 'John Antonakis']",92,False,Academy of Management Journal,[],1,96.05404498153743,0.0021574121578068063,0.3333333333333333,0.10151018851046475

Parenting Attributions and Attitudes in Cross-Cultural Perspective,2011,https://doi.org/10.1080/15295192.2011.585568,164,"SYNOPSIS SYNOPSIS Objective. This article used the Parenting Across Cultures Project to evaluate similarities and differences in mean levels and relative agreement between mothers' and fathers' attributions and attitudes in parenting in 9 countries. Design. Mothers and fathers reported their perceptions of causes of successes and failures in caregiving and their progressive versus authoritarian childrearing attitudes. Gender and cultural similarities and differences in parents' attributions and attitudes in 9 countries were analyzed: China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. Results. Although mothers and fathers did not differ in any attribution, mothers reported more progressive parenting attitudes and modernity of childrearing attitudes than did fathers, and fathers reported more authoritarian attitudes than did mothers. Country differences also emerged in all attributions and attitudes that were examined. Mothers' and fathers' attributions and their attitudes were moderately correlated, but parenting attitudes were more highly correlated in parents than were attributions. Conclusions. We draw connections among the findings across the 9 countries and outline implications for understanding similarities and differences in mothers' and fathers' parenting attributions and attitudes.

Using composite images of those scoring high and low on a particular trait, the current study shows that judges perform better than chance in guessing others' personality, particularly for the traits conscientiousness and extraversion. This study also shows that attractiveness, masculinity and age may all provide cues to assess personality accurately and that accuracy is affected by the sex of both of those judging and being judged. Individuals do perform better than chance at guessing another's personality from only facial information, providing some support for the popular belief that it is possible to assess accurately personality from faces.","['Psychology', 'Personality', 'Attribution', 'Attractiveness', 'Conscientiousness', 'Extraversion and introversion', 'Trait', 'Social psychology', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Impression formation', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Social perception', 'Perception', 'Neuroscience', 'Computer science', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Programming language']","['Anthony C.

College students completed scales assessing depression, loneliness, and shyness. In addition, they completed a questionnaire that measured attributional style on five causal dimensions (locus, stability, controllability, globality, and intentionality) for four types of situations (interpersonal success and failure, noninterpersonal success and failure. The results of a series of regression and correlation analyses led to the following major conclusions: (1) Globality, intentionality, and stability may be dropped from attributional models of depression, loneliness, and shyness with little loss of predictive power; (2) controllability is the single most important dimension in predicting a person's level of depression, loneliness, or shyness; (3) locus adds to the prediction of these symptoms only w hen assessed by failure items; and (4) attributional style predicts these symptoms especially well when it is assessed by the type of situation items that are particularly relevant to the symptom.

Recent studies of relationships between estrogen and Alzheimer's disease have prompted interest in memory experiences around the time of menopause. The purpose of this analysis, part of the larger Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study (SMWHS), was to describe the types of memory changes women perceived during midlife, to describe their attributions about the memory changes, and to describe the relationship among these types and attributions of memory changes and age, menopausal transition stage, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, stress, and major life roles. Women (n = 230) with a mean age of 46.7 years, enrolled in the SMWHS, described whether they had noticed any changes in their memory, when they noticed them first, the nature of the changes, and what they thought were the reasons for the changes. Types of memory changes were collapsed into five categories, which included difficulty recalling words or numbers, forgetting related to everyday behavior, concentration problems, need for memory aids, and forgetting events. Six categories describing attributions about the memory changes were increased role burden and stress, getting older, physical health, menstrual cycle changes/hormones, inadequate concentration, and emotional factors. Stress, physical health, and aging as attributions, rather than the menstrual cycle or hormone use, were linked to most types of memory change.","['Forgetting', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Menopause', 'Menstrual cycle', 'Developmental psychology', 'Disease', 'Gerontology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Hormone', 'Pathology', 'Internal medicine']","['Ellen Sullivan Mitchell', 'Nancy Fúgate Woods']",34,False,Journal of Women s Health & Gender-Based Medicine,[],1,95.9342061094327,0.002104792349079811,0.3333333333333333,0.10147335464435586

Design/methodology/approach IT personnel from large Australian organisations completed an adapted version of the Attributional Styles questionnaire, which asked them to attribute causes along a number of attribution dimensions, for IT projects which have either succeeded or failed. Findings The results indicate that IT support workers attribute failure to external factors, whilst attributing success to themselves. On the other hand, executive management took a more balanced perspective which attribute success to external factors and only partially to themselves, whereas they attribute significant personal responsibility for failure. Practical implications More junior professionals and operational IT employees can learn from their senior professionals in attributing success and failure. Post‐implementation reviews and debriefings conducted by senior IT professionals are ways of passing on their experience in relation to project and self‐evaluations.

The impact of attributions in marriage: a longitudinal analysis.,1987,,159,"In this study, we investigate the longitudinal relation between attributions for relationship events and marital satisfaction. Thirty-four couples were assessed at two points separated by approximately 12 months. Causal and responsibility attributions for marital difficulties and negative spouse behaviors were strongly related to concurrent marital satisfaction. For wives, later marital satisfaction was predicted by both causal and responsibility attributions after the effects of earlier satisfaction were removed. For husbands, attributions did not predict later marital satisfaction. Marital satisfaction did not predict later attributions for either husbands or wives. Marital satisfaction and the two types of attributions were related to concurrent unrealistic relationship expectations, but these expectations did not predict later marital satisfaction.

This study examines the influence of beliefs about the cause of homo‐sexuality on public policy attitudes concerning gay rights. Methods. Using data from the 1995 Oklahoma City Survey, we examine how beliefs about homosexuality as either a lifestyle choice or biological predisposition affect levels of support for gay rights. Results. Consistent with current debates over gay rights, our study reveals a strong positive association between biological attributions of homosexuality and support for gay rights. Opposition to gay rights is most pronounced among political conservatives, fundamentalist Protestants, persons with little or no favorable contact with gays, individuals who embrace negative stereotypes about gays, and persons with high scores on an index of homophobia.

Fifteen purposefully sampled professional players were interviewed about their rugby-related experiences. The experiences described by some players included cognitive and affective states reminiscent of the sport-specific burnout syndrome conceptualization forwarded by CitationRaedeke and Smith (2001) (i.e., exhaustion, reduced accomplishment and sport devaluation) that was grounded in the original human care literature (e.g., CitationMaslach, 1982).

College students were preselected on the basis of their attributional styles for interpersonal failures, as measured by the Attributional Style Assessment Test (Anderson, Horowitz, & French,1983).

Subsequently, subjects engaged in a blood drive task over the telephone, trying to persuade other students to donate blood. Success expectancies, motivation, and actual performance were assessed. As predicted, subjects who made strategy-/efforttype attributions, whether by experimental manipulation or by preselection, expected more success, expected more improvement with practice, displayed higher levels of motivation, and performed better at the task than did subjects who made ability/trait-type attributions.

Previous studies have suggested that both lonely and depressed individuals ascribe failure to characterological defects in themselves. However, the prototype of a lonely person and the prototype of a depressed person suggest that this characteristic attributional style should mainly hold for interpersonal failures. A questionnaire was formed, consisting of 20 hypothetical situations. Half of the situations were interpersonal, and half were not; half described successful outcomes, and half described failures. The subject selected an attributional alternative that best explained the outcome. The questionnaire was administered to 304 students, along with the Beck Depression Inventory and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The results showed that lonely and depressed people ascribe interpersonal failures to unchangeable characterological defects in themselves (e.g., a lack of ability). Because the prototype of a lonely person is more singularly interpersonal than is the prototype of a depressed person, we hypothesized that loneliness would show higher correlations with the attributional style. This hypothesis was also confirmed.

The study applied Weiner's (1980, 1986) attributional model of helping behaviour to Accident and Emergency (A&E) staff's care of patients presenting with deliberate self-harm. It was hypothesized that where staff attributed precipitants of the act of deliberate self-harm to controllable, internal, and stable patient factors, then staff would display greater negative affect, less optimism, and less willingness to help the patient. Design. Using four hypothetical scenarios in a two-factor between-subjects design, contextual factors describing a self-harm patient were manipulated. Method. Participants were 89 A&E medical and nursing staff. They were asked to rate attributions for the cause of the deliberate self-harm and their emotional responses, optimism for change, and willingness to help change the behaviour. Their general attitudes towards deliberate self-harm patients and perceived needs for training in the care of these patients were also assessed. Results. The findings were consistent with Weiner's attributional model of helping. The greater attributions of controllability, the greater the negative affect of staff towards the person, and the less the propensity to help. The higher the ratings of stability of outcome, the less staff optimism for the success of their input. Male staff and medical staff had more negative attitudes, and medical staff saw less need for further training. Conclusion.

In this article, we present the results of a systematic study of two important parameters in supervised machine learning that significantly affect performance in computational authorship attribution: (1) the number of candidate authors (i.e. the number of classes to be learned), and (2) the amount of training data available per candidate author (i.e. the size of the training data). We also investigate the robustness of different types of lexical and linguistic features to the effects of author set size and data size. The approach we take is an operationalization of the standard text categorization model, using memory-based learning for discriminating between the candidate authors. We performed authorship attribution experiments on a set of three benchmark corpora in which the influence of topic could be controlled. The short text fragments of e-mail length present the approach with a true challenge. Results show that, as expected, authorship attribution accuracy deteriorates as the number of candidate authors increases and size of training data decreases, although the machine learning approach continues performing significantly above chance. Some feature types (most notably character n-grams) are robust to changes in author set size and data size, but no robust individual features emerge.","['Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Robustness (evolution)', 'Operationalization', 'Attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Categorization', 'Authorship attribution', 'Machine learning', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Gene', 'Programming language']","['Koen Luyckx', 'Walter Daelemans']",53,False,Literary and Linguistic Computing,[],1,95.60590802282644,0.001973242827262323,0.3333333333333333,0.10138126997908362

An attempt to identify individuals who tended to be very consistent in their causal attributions on the ASQ similarly did not provide strong support for the attributional style concept. In Study 2 the relation between scores on the ASQ and causal attributions for actual negative events was examined. Attributional style scores were found to be poor predictors of actual causal attributions, and selecting highly consistent individuals did not improve the ASQ's predictive validity.

Why Is the Crowd Divided? Attribution for Dispersion in Online Word of Mouth,2015,https://doi.org/10.1086/680667,147,"Abstract The widespread availability of online word of mouth (WOM) enables modern consumers to assess not only the opinions of others about products and services, but also the extent to which those opinions are consistent or dispersive. Despite longstanding calls for greater understanding of mixed opinions, existing evidence is inconclusive regarding effects of WOM dispersion, and theoretical accounts have relied primarily on the notion of reference dependence. Extending prior work, this research proposes an attribution-based account, in which consumer interpretation of WOM dispersion depends on the extent to which tastes in a product domain are perceived to be dissimilar, so that dispersion can be attributed to inconsistency in reviewer preferences rather than the product itself. Across four experimental studies, participants presented with online rating distributions were more tolerant of dispersion in taste-dissimilar product domains than taste-similar product domains, and the difference was driven by underlying attributions. Together, these findings expand current understanding of WOM, social distributions, and risk perception, by revealing distinct pathways through which consumers respond to differences of opinion. In addition, they suggest the opportunity to proactively influence the manner in which dispersion is perceived, highlighting its positive connotations while diminishing its association with risk.","['Attribution', 'Word of mouth', 'Product (mathematics)', 'Psychology', 'Taste', 'Perception', 'Social psychology', 'Dispersion (optics)', 'Risk perception', 'Interpretation (philosophy)', 'Consumer behaviour', 'Advertising', 'Business', 'Computer science', 'Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Geometry', 'Neuroscience', 'Optics', 'Programming language']","['Stephen X.

These relationships have mainly been considered in terms of social risk mechanisms, and little is known about the role of genetic influences. Method: Self‐reported measures of attributional style, depression symptoms and parental disciplinary styles were administered to over 1300 adolescent twin and sibling pairs. Model‐fitting techniques were used to examine the role of genetic and environmental influences. Results: Moderate genetic influences on attributional style were demonstrated, and furthermore, its association with depression reflected considerable genetic effects. Familial factors were implicated in the association between attributional style and punitive parenting, although genetic from shared environmental causes could not be distinguished.

It also tested three models of how ethnic group identification is related to discrimination attributions, discrimination appraisals, and personal self-esteem. In a cross-sectional study of 160 Latino-American students, group identification was positively related to attributing ambiguous negative events to discrimination. Discrimination attributions were related to appraising discrimination as more global and severe. These latter appraisals, in turn, were related to lower self-esteem. No direct relationships were observed between self-esteem and either group identification or discrimination attributions.

In this study, we investigated the mediating and moderating role of two types of attributional mechanisms (hostile and self‐blaming attributions) on children’s maladjustment (externalizing and internalizing problems). Methods: In total, 478 children participated in this longitudinal study from grade 5 to grade 7. Children, parents, and teachers repeatedly completed questionnaires. Peer victimization was assessed through peer reports (T1). Attributions were assessed through self‐reports using hypothetical scenarios (T2). Parents and teachers reported on children’s maladjustment (T1 and T3). Results: Peer victimization predicted increases in externalizing and internalizing problems. Hostile attributions partially mediated the impact of victimization on increases in externalizing problems. Self‐blame was not associated with peer victimization. However, for children with higher levels of self‐blaming attributions, peer victimization was linked more strongly with increases in internalizing problems. Conclusions: Results imply that hostile attributions may operate as a potential mechanism through which negative experiences with peers lead to increases in children’s aggressive and delinquent behavior, whereas self‐blame exacerbates victimization’s effects on internalizing problems.","['Peer victimization', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Aggression', 'Blame', 'Developmental psychology', 'Attribution bias', 'Poison control', 'Social psychology', 'Human factors and ergonomics', 'Medicine', 'Environmental health']","['Sonja Perren', 'Idean Ettekal', 'Gary W.

Study 2 was identical to Study 1 with the exception that Ss' memory perspectives were manipulated via verbal instructions. In both experiments, conversations that were recalled from an observer's perspective were attributed more dispositionally.

Dyadic Communication Relationships in Organizations: An Attribution/Expectancy Approach,2000,https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.11.6.648.12537,142,"Research in organizational communication has examined the structure and content of interaction, but has paid little attention to research traditions outside the organizational sciences that explore the social-psychological interconnections between relationship development and interaction. In this paper we draw upon and extend those traditions to develop a model of how communication relationships develop within organizational dyads. The proposed model examines organization-based communication relationships through a synthesis of theoretical perspectives on communication richness, relational communication, interpersonal attribution, and social expectancy. We also call upon precepts of structuration theory to embed these microlevel processes in an organizational context. The relational outcome in the model is “interactional richness,” a dyad-level construct that assesses the extent to which communication within the dyad is high in shared meaning. Model antecedents are aspects of interaction through which communicators reciprocally define their relationships, including relational message properties, message patterns that emerge over time, and relational perceptions. We propose that these communication properties and behaviors give rise to relationship attributions. We then incorporate processes of expectancy confirmation and violation to explain how specific communication encounters lead individuals to reformulate attributions regarding the status of a given relationship. Research propositions articulate how attribution/expectancy processes mediate between relational communication behavior and relationship development outcomes. We also develop propositions addressing how relational communication behavior is influenced by macrolevel factors, including hierarchy, structure, and culture. In a concluding section we discuss the model's potential contribution to research and practice, address its limitations, and offer recommendations for future research aimed at testing its ","['Dyad', 'Attribution', 'Expectancy theory', 'Psychology', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Organizational communication', 'Social psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Social information processing', 'Knowledge management', 'Computer science', 'Cognition', 'Paleontology', 'Neuroscience', 'Biology']","['Bruce Barry', 'J.

Specifically, this study investigated whether attributions and emotions in situations of social inclusion and exclusion differ between chronically lonely adolescents and adolescents with a different loneliness history. A total of 730 adolescents (Mage at Wave 1 = 15.43 years) participated in a 4-wave longitudinal study with annual loneliness assessments. A chronic loneliness trajectory was identified, in addition to low-stable, moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing loneliness trajectories. At Wave 4, vignettes depicting social inclusion and exclusion were presented, and participants rated a set of attributions and emotions following each vignette. Compared with individuals following other trajectories, chronically lonely adolescents were characterized by hypersensitivity to social exclusion (i.e., higher levels of negative emotions) and hyposensitivity to social inclusion (i.e., lower levels of enthusiasm). Further, chronically lonely adolescents had a stronger tendency to attribute social inclusion to circumstantial factors and social exclusion to internal and stable characteristics. This maladaptive attribution style partially mediated their emotional experiences.

Emotions and moods may influence decision makers in 3 ways: by affecting their information processing strategies, by inclining their judgments in the direction of the valence of the emotion or mood, and/or by providing informational cues to the proper decision. A model is proposed that incorporates these effects and further distinguishes among various affective influences in terms of whether the affect is provoked by a source integral or incidental to the judgment task, and whether it affects judgment directly (e.g., by providing an informational cue to judgment) or indirectly (e.g., by affecting construal of judgment target features, which in turn affects the judgment).

Attributions and behaviours of parents abused as children: a mediational analysis of the intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment (Part II),2004,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00340.x,138,"This study extends previous research (Dixon, Browne, & Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2004) by exploring the mediational properties of parenting styles and their relation to risk factors in the intergenerational cycle of child maltreatment. Families with newborns where at least one of the parents was physically and/or sexually abused as a child (AP families) were compared, in terms of parents' attributions and behaviour, to families where the parents had no childhood history of victimization (NAP families).Information was collected from 4351 families (135 AP families) by community nurses as part of the 'health visiting' service. The same health visitor visited each family twice at home when the child was 4 to 6 weeks and 3 to 5 months of age, to assess behavioural indicators of positive parenting.Within 13 months after birth, 9 (6.7%) AP families were referred for maltreating their own child in comparison to 18 (.4%) NAP families. Assessments found a significantly higher number of risk factors and measures indicating poor parenting for AP families. Mediational analysis found that intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment was explained to a larger extent (62% of the total effect) by the presence of poor parenting styles together with the three significant risk factors (parenting under 21 years, history of mental illness or depression, residing with a violent adult). The three risk factors alone were less explanatory (53% of the total effect).This study provides an explanation for why a minority of parents abused in childhood go on to maltreat their own infant, evidencing poor parenting styles and mediating risk factors. Hence, prevention may be enhanced in AP families by the promotion of 'positive parenting' in addition to providing additional support to young parents, tackling mental illness/depression and domestic violence problems.","['Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Attribution', 'Parenting styles', 'Mental health', 'Child abuse', 'Injury prevention', 'Poison control', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Environmental health']","['Louise Dixon', 'Catherine Hamilton‐Giachritsis', 'Kevin D.

Teacher attributions of student failure and teacher behavior toward the failing student,2002,https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.10049,137,"Abstract The aim of this study was to examine the relation between teacher attributions of student school failure and teacher behavior toward the failing student. A structural equation model was proposed and its ability to fit the data was tested. It was found that teachers tend to behave in ways that indicate more pity and less anger when they attribute a student's low achievement to her or his low abilities, whereas they express more anger when attributing low achievement to the student's low effort. In contrast to previous research that argues in favor of anger as a high ability cue, this study has found that the presence of anger was associated with a teacher tendency to give‐up efforts to help the student improve. This giving‐up behavior was negatively related to the tendency of the teachers to accept some responsibility for the student failure. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['Anger', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Pity', 'Student achievement', 'Social psychology', 'Academic achievement', 'Mathematics education', 'Developmental psychology']","['Στέλιος Ν.

Authorship Attribution for Twitter in 140 Characters or Less,2010,https://doi.org/10.1109/ctc.2010.17,136,"Authorship attribution is a growing field, moving from beginnings in linguistics to recent advances in text mining. Through this change came an increase in the capability of authorship attribution methods both in their accuracy and the ability to consider more difficult problems. Research into authorship attribution in the 19th century considered it difficult to determine the authorship of a document of fewer than 1000 words. By the 1990s this values had decreased to less than 500 words and in the early 21st century it was considered possible to determine the authorship of a document in 250 words. The need for this ever decreasing limit is exemplified by the trend towards many shorter communications rather than fewer longer communications, such as the move from traditional multi-page handwritten letters to shorter, more focused emails. This trend has also been shown in online crime, where many attacks such as phishing or bullying are performed using very concise language. Cybercrime messages have long been hosted on Internet Relay Chats (IRCs) which have allowed members to hide behind screen names and connect anonymously. More recently, Twitter and other short message based web services have been used as a hosting ground for online crimes. This paper presents some evaluations of current techniques and identifies some new preprocessing methods that can be used to enable authorship to be determined at rates significantly better than chance for documents of 140 characters or less, a format popularised by the micro-blogging website Twitter1. We show that the SCAP methodology performs extremely well on twitter messages and even with restrictions on the types of information allowed, such as the recipient of directed messages, still perform significantly higher than chance. Further to this, we show that 120 tweets per user is an important threshold, at which point adding more tweets per user gives a small but non-significant increase in accuracy.","['Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Unicode', 'World Wide Web', 'Phishing', 'The Internet', 'Cybercrime', 'Social media', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Preprocessor', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics']","['Robert Layton', 'Paul Watters', 'Richard Dazeley']",36,False,,[],1,95.02081235313864,0.0017890734967178394,0.3333333333333333,0.10125235144770248

Second, within the internal/external categories, causes that are presumed to be relatively stable are distinguished from causes that are presumed to be more easily variable. This paper outlines the theoretical arguments that underlie the attributional framework's four-fold classification of answers, describes the issues that arise in the process of coding the respondents' answers, and presents two sets of items (complete with their attributional codings) that can be used to make specific identifications of attributions from the open-ended responses. The attributional framework is compared to more traditional qualitative methods for evaluating the open-ended responses of nascent entrepreneurs.

First, the attributions spouses make for their partners' behaviors have been treated as a style or a trait, reflecting enduring aspects of the perceiver. Second, attributions have been described as a causal factor in the development of the marriage over time. To evaluate the evidence for these assumptions, the authors analyzed 8 waves of longitudinal data from a sample of newlywed couples. Results offered no support for the idea of an enduring attributional style; attributions changed linearly, and changes in attributions were strongly associated with changes in marital satisfaction within each spouse. Nevertheless, controlling for these associations, initial levels of attributions predicted changes in marital satisfaction more than initial satisfaction predicted changes in attributions.

In this introductory paper we analyse recent developments in citizenship attribution across Western Europe over the past 25 years. Despite the contradictory impact of the instrumentalisation and politicisation of citizenship policies, and the fact that countries have different citizenship traditions and migration experiences, we observe six broad trends. These relate to the descent-based transmission of citizenship by women, men and emigrants; ius soli provisions for second- and third-generation immigrants; the acceptance of multiple citizenship; the introduction of language and integration requirements for naturalisation; the avoidance of statelessness; and the increasing relevance of EU membership. We describe the background and core features of each of these six trends and provide empirical examples from citizenship policies in 18 West European countries since the early 1980s.","['Citizenship', 'Naturalisation', 'Statelessness', 'Political science', 'Immigration', 'Attribution', 'Emigration', 'Western europe', 'Development economics', 'Political economy', 'Sociology', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Social psychology', 'International trade', 'European union', 'Psychology', 'Politics']","['Maarten Vink', 'Gérard-René de Groot']",25,False,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,[],1,94.82611614635785,0.0017364536879908442,0.3333333333333333,0.10121551758159358

Consequently, several listings of relevant analytical categories have been proposed and applied to many subsequent studies. However, the variety of the proposed methods in representation of social groups by various scholars and the often unclear accounts for the links among various levels of discourse analysis seem to have created a multitude of discursive strategies that can be overwhelming if not confusing. This paper is an attempt to make explicit various levels of discourse analysis on representation of social groups from detailed textual analysis to discourse topics and tries to show how micro-level analytical categories are related to macro-structure within various levels of contexts. Specifically, a three-level analytical framework is suggested for textual analysis of the representation of social groups which divides the text analysis into three domains of social actors, social actions and argumentation. It is suggested that the analysis should look at what is (not) in the text in terms of the three domains mentioned, and investigate how these domains are linguistically realized through a set of linguistic processes/mechanisms.","['Argumentation theory', 'Multitude', 'Representation (politics)', 'Social representation', 'Discourse analysis', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Action (physics)', 'Linguistics', 'Variety (cybernetics)', 'Sociology', 'Social group', 'Epistemology', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Programming language']",['Majid KhosraviNik'],53,False,Critical Discourse Studies,[],1,94.82611614635785,0.0017364536879908442,0.3333333333333333,0.10121551758159358

"Social representations, social attribution and social identity: The intergroup images of ‘public’ and ‘comprehensive’ schoolboys",1982,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2420120302,131,"Abstract Investigated the relationship between social representations, intergroup causal attributions and the search for a positive social identity in two rival groups from British secondary education. Part I studied the shared social beliefs 0f 20 ‘Public’ (PS) and 20 ‘Comprehensive’ (CS) schoolboys (age 16 years) concerning similarities and differences between the two types of schoolboy. Each subject wrote a short essay on the topic and these essays were content‐analysed into 13 differences and 4 similarities between the two types of school. The two groups agreed on a number of points, but consensus within each group on a number of beliefs revealed distinct social representations. Part II studied the effect of group membership and social categorization on causal attributions for success and failure in examinations. Twenty‐four PS and 24 CS boys {age 16–17 years) were used in a 2 (school of subjects) × 2 (school of stimuli) × 2 (success/failure) design, with one between and two within‐subject factors. Each subject read four background descriptions of candidates for university entrance, then made a number of ratings. On the page following each description, subjects attributed the candidate's performance to ability, effort, task difficulty and luck; a confidence rating was also made. Analyses of variance suggested that second‐order interactions between group membership of the subjects, social categorization of the stimuli and achievement outcome were most important. Public schoolboys differentiated themselves from the CS boys by means of ability (p &lt; 0.08 and effort (p &lt; 0.0005) attributions; CS boys differentiated in tern of luck (p &lt; 0.06). Part III studied social identity processes in the same 48 subjects.

In doing so, the relationship between satisfaction and service quality is clarified. Research hypotheses are critically evaluated through the use of a scenario-based experiment. Implications concern the ability of recovery to mitigate the harm caused by failure.

A novel approach of mining write-prints for authorship attribution in e-mail forensics,2008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2008.05.001,129,"There is an alarming increase in the number of cybercrime incidents through anonymous e-mails. The problem of e-mail authorship attribution is to identify the most plausible author of an anonymous e-mail from a group of potential suspects. Most previous contributions employed a traditional classification approach, such as decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the author and studied the effects of different writing style features on the classification accuracy. However, little attention has been given on ensuring the quality of the evidence. In this paper, we introduce an innovative data mining method to capture the write-print of every suspect and model it as combinations of features that occurred frequently in the suspect's e-mails. This notion is called frequent pattern, which has proven to be effective in many data mining applications, but it is the first time to be applied to the problem of authorship attribution. Unlike the traditional approach, the extracted write-print by our method is unique among the suspects and, therefore, provides convincing and credible evidence for presenting it in a court of law. Experiments on real-life e-mails suggest that the proposed method can effectively identify the author and the results are supported by a strong evidence.","['Authorship attribution', 'Suspect', 'Computer science', 'Attribution', 'Decision tree', 'Support vector machine', 'Quality (philosophy)', 'Information retrieval', 'Data mining', 'Data science', 'Computer security', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Criminology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology']","['Farkhund Iqbal', 'Rachid Hadjidj', 'Benjamin C.

Enlisting data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, measures of the security of attachment in infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, together with measures of parenting quality (maternal sensitivity and depressive symptoms) gathered longitudinally throughout infancy and early childhood, were used to predict differences in children's thoughts and feelings about peers (i.e., social problem solving, negative attributional biases, aggressive solutions to ambiguous social situations, and self-reported loneliness) when children were 54 months and in first grade. Relational experiences, especially before 36 months, were significantly predictive of later peer-related representations. Attachment security at 24 and 36 months was associated with enhanced social problem-solving skills and less loneliness, but security of attachment at 15 months was nonpredictive. Early maternal sensitivity was positively associated with later social problem-solving and negatively with aggressive responses, and early maternal depressive symptoms were positively associated with children's negative attributions. Concurrent parenting quality was also associated with children's thoughts and feelings about peers, but less consistently. These findings shed new light on how early relational experiences may contribute to social information processing with peers at the end of the preschool years, and that the timing of relational influences may be crucial.","['Psychology', 'Loneliness', 'Developmental psychology', 'Feeling', 'Attribution', 'Early childhood', 'Social information processing', 'Social psychology', 'Cognition', 'Neuroscience']","['Helen Raikes', 'Ross A.

In both studies, the attributions of spouses seeking therapy were investigated in relation to those of happily married persons in the community. The results showed that self-other attribution differences varied as a function of marital distress. Nondistressed spouses showed a positive attribution bias by making more benign attributions for partner behavior as opposed to self-behavior, whereas distressed spouses showed a negative attribution bias by making less benign attributions for partner behavior than for self-behavior.

Mothers' scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were found to be associated with 'child-blaming' attributions and higher levels of EE.

Hypothesizing that religious attributions are a function of situational and stylistic factors, the present work deals with event-character and contextual influences which are aspects of the former. Twelve short stories picturing positive or negative social, economic, and medical occurrences varying in importance were written. In our initial experiment, these were administered under personal or impersonal-reference conditions to 135 respondents. The degree to which God was seen as involved in each happening was assessed. A four-factor ANOVA revealed God attributions varied meaningfully with event-domain, positive-negativeness, and event-importance. Significant interactions among these factors and with the personal-impersonal condition were also observed. In our second experiment, an experimental manipulation of a personal-impersonal experimental condition produced evidence that more God attributions result in personal than impersonal circumstances. An attempt to assess the effect of a church vs. a nonchurch context resulted in negative findings and recommends the necessity of making this potential source of influence more salient in future work. The utility of attributional concepts to explain much religious activity is increasingly apparent.","['Attribution', 'Character (mathematics)', 'Psychology of religion', 'Event (particle physics)', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Religious studies', 'Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Geometry', 'Quantum mechanics']","['Bernard Spilka', 'Greg W.

Three studies are presented which investigate how candidate and interviewer locus of control influence preferences for three categories of explanations proffered by candidates during graduate recruitment interviews.

Students also completed Rotter's Locus of Control questionnaire and the Interview Behaviour Scales. Students and personnel managers rated internal‐controllable attributions most likely to create a positive impression. However, students with an external LoC rated external‐uncontrollable explanations and internal‐controllable explanations as being equally likely to convey a positive impression.

Parental attributions as predictors of involvement and influences on child achievement,1999,https://doi.org/10.1348/000709999157806,122,"This study, which was conducted in Cyprus, combines the theoretical framework of attribution research with that of parent involvement literature.Its aim was to investigate the role of parental attributions as predictors of parental involvement in their child's educational process and to examine the influence of both of these factors on the child's actual school achievement.The parents of 473 sixth grade students in 22 public elementary schools participated in the study. Data were also collected from students and their teachers.Participating parents completed questionnaires regarding their attributions of their child's achievement and their own degree of involvement in his/her life.It was found that parents who believed that their own role was important for their child's achievement tended to be more controlling and to be keener in developing the child's interests. Also, the parental attribution of the child's achievement to the child's own effort was positively related to the child's actual achievement results. Finally, it was found that the child's actual school achievement was directly related to the parental interest-developing behaviour, but it was not significantly related to the parental controlling behaviour.Through a structural equation model and a path analysis procedure, it was shown that a line of influence exists between parental attribution style, the type and degree of parental involvement and the child's actual academic achievement.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Academic achievement', 'Path analysis (statistics)', 'Parenting styles', 'Social psychology', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']",['Στέλιος Ν.

The present study was designed to demonstrate that using the other's language may not necessarily lead to positive evaluation and reciprocal accommodation. Guided by attribution theory, three conditions were created involving English Canadians who spoke French or English to French Canadian subjects: (1) Subjects were given no information about the language capacity of the English Canadian speaker, (2) the speaker was externally pressured to use French or English, and (3) Subjects were aware that the speaker was capable of speaking French. The results demonstrated that the accommodation model was not sufficient in its original form to account for language choice in all contexts and an elaboration was suggested in attribution terms.","['Accommodation', 'Attribution', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Reciprocal', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience']","['Lise M.

Hyperactive boys were tutored individually for 2 months in a classroom setting; half were instructed in self-controlling speech, and half were given contingent social reinforcement. Within each treatment group, half of the children were taking methylphenidate (Ritalin), and half were unmedicated. 2 dependent measures were used: (a) qualitative-error scores on the Porteus Mazes and (b) the Conners Abbreviated Teacher Rating Scale.

Significant interactions were found between interventions and (a) child attributions and (b) medication status. The self-control intervention produced significantly greater error reduction on the mazes for (a) children with high perceived personal causality and (b) nonmedicated children.

Subjects then failed at their initial persuasion attempt. Following failure, strategy subjects expected more successes in future attempts than did ability subjects. Strategy subjects also expected to improve with practice, while ability subjects did not. Comparisons to control subjects, who received no attribution manipulation prior to success or failure, clarify these results. Findings suggest that subjects attributing task outcomes to strategies monitored the effectiveness of their strategies and concluded that by modifying their strategies they would become more successful. In contrast, subjects attributing task outcome to abilities failed to attend to strategic features and concluded that they could not improve.

It also explores the role that the restorative capacity of a place—in terms of the attentional restoration theory (ART)—together with a set of aesthetic attributes, may play in more or less valued places in a city. A total of 132 residents from Málaga (Spain) were chosen, with the city providing the physical framework for environmental reference. A questionnaire designed for easy self-administration by subjects was used to collect information. Subjects were asked to identify three places in Málaga that they considered to be most attractive and three that they considered least attractive. Participants were asked to evaluate both the restorative properties—in terms of the ART—and the extent to which their first choice displayed certain environmental characteristics. Participants expressed a clear aesthetic preference for recreational sites for leisure/walking as well as those closely linked to the city's historical-cultural identity. The research also identified other categories of visual settings that could be used as a focal point around which to centre future samples of scenes in a city context. Finally, the results obtained from the characterization of more and less attractive places, from the variables used in this study, shed light on the dimensions of underlying meaning that individuals use to categorize their environment and reinforce the idea that environmental aesthetics seem to play an important role in individuals' general well-being.

This model distinguishes between four classes of interpersonal terms (descriptive action verbs, interpretive action verbs, state verbs, and adjectives) that have been shown to mediate different cognitive inferences. An adaptation of this language based model suggests that actor‐observer differences can be understood as differential language conventions used by actors and observers. This hypothesis finds support in the first study where subjects were asked to give free descriptions to a number of social events. A second study examined the more specific implications of this general case by replicating an experiment reported by Nisbett et al. (1973). The same language based conventions are shown to be used by actors and observers in this more specific case. The implications of these findings are drawn out with special reference to the influence of culture on cognitive processes.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Cognition', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Action (physics)', 'Social cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Observer (physics)', 'Cognitive linguistics', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience']","['Gün R.

Children's judgments of personal competence, expectancies for success, causal attributions for failure, and persistence on the task were measured. Across all Race X Social Class groups, there were linkages between communicated sympathy and low ability self-ascriptions and between communicated anger and lack of effort attributions, although the sympathy-ability relation was stronger than the anger-effort linkage. In addition, a greater decline in expectancy for success followed the emotional cue of sympathy. These findings were interpreted as further evidence of the role of emotions in an attributional theory of motivation. When the data were examined independent of affective cues, middle-class black children displayed a particularly adaptive attributional pattern. Compared with the other three demographic groups, these children attributed their failure more to insufficient effort, reported higher expectancies, perceived themselves as more competent, and persisted longer at the task. The implications of these findings for comparative racial research are discussed.","['Sympathy', 'Psychology', 'Anger', 'White (mutation)', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Attribution', 'Social cognition', 'Social perception', 'Developmental psychology', 'Perception', 'Neuroscience', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene']",['Sandra Graham'],27,False,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,[],1,93.97482376636455,0.0015259744530828631,0.3333333333333333,0.101068182117158

Centrality and charisma: Comparing how leader networks and attributions affect team performance.,2011,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0024890,112,"When leaders interact in teams with their subordinates, they build social capital that can have positive effects on team performance. Does this social capital affect team performance because subordinates come to see the leader as charismatic? We answered this question by examining 2 models. First, we tested the charisma-to-centrality model according to which the leader's charisma facilitates the occupation of a central position in the informal advice network. From this central position, the leader positively influences team performance. Second, we examined the centrality-to-charisma model according to which charisma is attributed to those leaders who are socially active in terms of giving and receiving advice. Attributed charisma facilitates increased team performance. We tested these 2 models in 2 different studies. In the first study, based on time-separated, multisource data emanating from members of 56 work teams, we found support for the centrality-to-charisma model. Formal leaders who were central within team advice networks were seen as charismatic by subordinates, and this charisma was associated with high team performance. To clarify how leader network centrality affected the emergence of charismatic leadership, we designed Study 2 in which, for 79 student teams, we measured leader networking activity and leader charisma at 2 different points in time and related these variables to team performance measured at a third point in time. On the basis of this temporally separated data set, we again found support for the centrality-to-charisma model.","['Centrality', 'Charisma', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Charismatic authority', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Position (finance)', 'Transformational leadership', 'Social network (sociolinguistics)', 'Attribution', 'Public relations', 'Business', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Social media', 'Communication', 'Mathematics', 'Finance', 'Combinatorics']","['Prasad Balkundi', 'Martín Kilduff', 'David A.

The current study operationalizes this notion by asking the mothers of 354 7‐ to 11‐year‐old children drawn from a larger community sample ( N =659) to guess the responses of their children, who, in turn, were asked to attribute thoughts to their peers in distressing peer‐related scenarios. The following predictions were made: (1) mothers would be above chance in the accuracy by which they predicted their children's overall attributional styles; (2) increased maternal accuracy would be an important correlate of reduced psychopathology symptoms in children; and (3) poor maternal accuracy would associate with a maladaptive child attributional response style characterized by unrealistic and overly positive attributions. Results suggested that maternal accuracy was normally distributed with mothers accurately guessing the responses of their children for about half of the social scenarios. Furthermore, mothers were shown to be above chance in the accuracy by which they predicted their children's overall attributional styles. Maternal accuracy was found to be related to child psychosocial adjustment (reduced scores on child psychopathology measures), whilst poor maternal accuracy was associated with ineffective social‐cognitive reasoning, as indexed by an unrealistic and overly positive child attributional style.

Application of the Attribution-Value Model of Prejudice to Homosexuality,2002,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224540209603899,107,"According to the attribution-value model, prejudice toward a group stems from 2 interrelated variables: attributions of controllability and cultural value. Thus, prejudice toward gay men and lesbians may stem from others' holding them responsible for their behaviors and perceiving negative cultural value regarding homosexuality. The author tested that model by using the issue of homosexuality. The participants were Turkish undergraduates who completed a homophobia scale and answered questions about the origins of homosexuality, cultural attitudes toward homosexuality, and their own gender and sexual preferences. In general, the participants were prejudiced against gay men and lesbians. As expected, attributions of controllability and negative cultural value regarding homosexuality operated jointly to explain 39% of the variation in homophobia. The participants who thought that homosexuality was controllable had more negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians than did those who thought that homosexuality was uncontrollable. The female participants were more tolerant of homosexuality than were the male participants.","['Homosexuality', 'Prejudice (legal term)', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Social psychology', 'Value (mathematics)', 'Turkish', 'Male Homosexuality', 'Men who have sex with men', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Medicine', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Syphilis', 'Family medicine', 'Machine learning', 'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)', 'Computer science']",['Nuray Sakallı-Uğurlu'],18,False,The Journal of Social Psychology,[],1,93.34172541121181,0.0014075798834471236,0.3333333333333333,0.10098530591841298

Local Histograms of Character N-grams for Authorship Attribution,2011,,107,"This paper proposes the use of local histograms (LH) over character n-grams for authorship attribution (AA). LHs are enriched histogram representations that preserve sequential information in documents; they have been successfully used for text categorization and document visualization using word histograms. In this work we explore the suitability of LHs over n-grams at the character-level for AA. We show that LHs are particularly helpful for AA, because they provide useful information for uncovering, to some extent, the writing style of authors. We report experimental results in AA data sets that confirm that LHs over character n-grams are more helpful for AA than the usual global histograms, yielding results far superior to state of the art approaches. We found that LHs are even more advantageous in challenging conditions, such as having imbalanced and small training sets. Our results motivate further research on the use of LHs for modeling the writing style of authors for related tasks, such as authorship verification and plagiarism detection.","['Character (mathematics)', 'Histogram', 'Categorization', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Writing style', 'Natural language processing', 'Text categorization', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Visualization', 'Word (group theory)', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Social psychology', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Geometry']","['Hugo Jair Escalante', 'Thamar Solorio', 'Manuel Montes-y-Gómez']",28,False,Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,[],1,93.34172541121181,0.0014075798834471236,0.3333333333333333,0.10098530591841298

Social Identity Reduces Depression by Fostering Positive Attributions,2014,https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550614543309,107,"Social identities are generally associated with better health and in particular lower levels of depression. However, there has been limited investigation of why social identities protect against depression. The current research suggests that social identities reduce depression in part because they attenuate the depressive attribution style (internal, stable, and global; e.g., “I failed because I’m stupid”). These relationships are first investigated in a survey (Study 1, N = 139) and then followed up in an experiment that manipulates social identity salience (Study 2, N = 88). In both cases, people with stronger social identities were less likely to attribute negative events to internal, stable, or global causes and subsequently reported lower levels of depression. These studies thus indicate that social identities can protect and enhance mental health by facilitating positive interpretations of stress and failure.

A Synthesis and Extension of the Weiner and Kelley Attribution Models,1998,https://doi.org/10.1207/s15324834basp2004_4,106,"Attribution theory and research has centered around 2 basic models: (a) the achievement-motivation model, which has been concerned primarily with self-attributions and is characterized by the work of Weiner and his colleagues (e.g., Weiner, 1986; Weiner et al., 1971), and (b) Kelley's cube, which has been used primarily to describe how observers use information to make attributions for the behavior of others (e.g., Green & Mitchell, 1979). The presence of these 2 distinct models, each with a different area and scope of application, has presented a number of problems for researchers in: comparing self- and social attributions; synthesizing the results of different studies; and examining the leader-member attribution process, particularly with respect to actor-observer biases.

Gender Differences in Mathematics and the Sciences: Can Attributional Retraining Improve the Performance of Gifted Females?,1996,https://doi.org/10.1177/001698629604000405,105,"There are probably no subject areas in which the problem of reducing gender differences is as urgent as in mathematics and the hard sciences.

We then discuss several attempts to explain these differences and show that until recently not enough attention has been paid to the girls' and women's self-related cognitions in these domains. They underestimate their own talents in mathematics and the sciences and, from a motivational perspective, attribute their successes and failures in such a way as to further inhibit motivation. Attributional retraining techniques could provide a solution to the problems of lowered motivation and performance. These retraining techniques have proved successful in clinical and laboratory settings, but they have not been tried in natural settings like schools and universities. Following an overview of the most important attributional retraining techniques, we describe two studies carried out with German high school students in mathematics and with female university students in statistics. Using an attributional retraining technique we developed, both studies report extremely promising results.

In Study 3 (N = 100), participants were exposed to mortality salience or control conditions, they were given or not given the opportunity to report attributions, and death-thought accessibility was assessed. Mortality salience led to more self-serving attributions than a control condition and these attributions were related to better emotional state and task performance.

This study tested whether these attributions in fact exert the claimed causal influence on emotional experiences. The study employed a procedural priming technique in which neutral events were repeatedly attributed either to oneself (internal attribution) or to another person (external attribution). Subsequently, participants were exposed to a negative event that was ambiguous as to its causes. The results reveal that the prior repeated use of internal attributions enhanced the tendency to experience guilt, whereas the repeated use of external attributions enhanced the tendency to experience anger.

At onset the ‘ME’ group were found to be more fatigued, had been tired for longer but were less psychologically distressed than the other two groups. At follow-up the ‘ME’ group were more handicapped in relation to home, work, social and private leisure activities, even when controlling for both duration of fatigue and fatigue at time 1, but were less psychologically distressed.

Results from the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (Piers, 1984) suggested that lower overall self-concepts in the students with learning disabilities (p &lt; .01) were primarily due to differences in self-concepts regarding intellectual and school status (p &lt; .001). Attributions regarding internal versus external causes for successes and failures and stable (ability) versus unstable (effort) causes for failures did not differentiate the groups. Self-concept, particularly school related self-concept, was correlated with ability/effort attributions. Subjects with lower self-concepts were more likely to attribute failures to ability.

Specifically, an attempt was made to provide an experimental test of the degree of linearity between familiarity and judgmental accuracy in detecting deception. After exposure to varying amounts of a communicator's normal, truthful behavior (baseline segment), observers made judgments of a communicator's veracity following observation of truthful or lying behavior (test segment). The results indicate a significant deviation from linearity in the relationship between familiarity and judgmental accuracy, and that the relationship is better described by an inverted parabolic curve (quadratic function). The possibility of information overload, the possibility of communicator-specific characteristics which provide clues to deception, and the possibility of observer fatigue were proposed as possible explanations of these results.","['Deception', 'Psychology', 'Observer (physics)', 'Lying', 'Social psychology', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Radiology', 'Medicine', 'Paleontology', 'Physics']","['David Brandt', 'Gerald R.

Sympathy was assessed with self‐report measures. Moral emotion attributions and moral reasoning were measured with children's responses to hypothetical moral transgressions. Parental support was assessed at all assessment points with primary caregiver and child reports. Three trajectory classes of sympathy were identified: high‐stable, average‐increasing, and low‐stable. Moral emotion attributions exhibited high‐stable, increasing, and decreasing trajectories. Moral reasoning displayed high‐stable, increasing, and low‐stable trajectories. Children who were in the high‐stable sympathy group had higher self‐reported support than children in the increasing and low‐stable trajectory groups. Children who were in the high‐stable moral emotion attribution group or the high‐stable moral reasoning group had higher primary caregiver‐reported support than children in the corresponding increasing trajectory groups. Furthermore, children who were members of the high‐stable group in all three moral development variables (i.e., sympathy, moral emotion attribution, and moral reasoning) displayed higher levels of self‐reported parental support than children who were not.","['Sympathy', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Moral disengagement', 'Moral reasoning', 'Social cognitive theory of morality', 'Developmental psychology', 'Moral development', 'Social psychology']","['Tina Malti', 'Nancy Eisenberg', 'Hyunji Kim', 'Marlis Buchmann']",48,False,Social Development,[],1,92.73850285330649,0.001302340265993133,0.3333333333333333,0.10091163818619518

Climate Change Attribution: When Is It Appropriate to Accept New Methods?,2018,https://doi.org/10.1002/2017ef000665,98,"Abstract The most common approaches to detection and attribution (D&amp;A) of extreme weather events using fraction of attributable risk or risk ratio answer a particular form of research question, namely “What is the probability of a certain class of weather events, given global climate change, relative to a world without?” In a set of recent papers, Trenberth et al. (2015, https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2657 ) and Shepherd (2016, https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641‐016‐0033‐y ) have argued that this is not always the best tool for analyzing causes, or for communicating with the public about climate events and extremes. Instead, they promote the idea of a “storyline” approach, which asks complementary questions, such as “How much did climate change affect the severity of a given storm?” From the vantage of history and philosophy of science, a proposal to introduce a new approach or to answer different research questions—especially those of public interest—does not appear particularly controversial. However, the proposal proved highly controversial, with the majority of D&amp;A scientists reacting in a very negative and even personal manner. Some suggested the proposed alternatives amount to a weakening of standards, or an abandonment of scientific method. Here, we address the question: Why is this such a controversial proposition? We argue that there is no “right” or “wrong” approach to D&amp;A in any absolute sense, but rather that in different contexts, society may have a greater or lesser concern with errors of a particular type. How we view the relative risk of overestimation versus underestimation of harm is context‐dependent.","['Climate change', 'Attribution', 'Climate science', 'Proposition', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Event (particle physics)', 'Global warming', 'Scientific consensus', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy of science', 'Positive economics', 'Political science', 'Computer science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Ecology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Programming language']","['Elisabeth A.

Second, an empirical case study is presented which uses attributional analysis to quantify the beliefs held by key stakeholder groups involved in a culture change programme within a multi‐national manufacturing organization. A total of 1230 attributional statements were coded using a modified version of the Leeds Attributional Coding System (LACS), which included four main dimensions: stable‐unstable, global‐specific, internal‐external, controllable‐uncontrollable.

The Denigration of Heroes? How the Status Attainment Process Shapes Attributions of Considerateness and Authenticity,2014,https://doi.org/10.1086/678304,97,"This article develops and tests a theory to explain the common tendency to ""denigrate heroes,"" whereby high-status actors are suspected of being inconsiderate and inauthentic relative to low-status counterparts. This tendency is argued to reflect two conditions typical of status attainment processes: (a) assertions of superiority over others and (b) the presence of incentives to pursue status. The latter is key since awareness of such incentives breeds suspicions of inauthenticity, which in turn undermine perceptions of prosocial intentions. This theory is validated in a series of online experiments, in which categorical status hierarchies emerge either via deference on a coordinated task or via competitive interactions. Results show that high-status actors may also be ""celebrated"" as authentic and considerate when the observable incentive structure is such that assertions of superiority appear as unintended by-products of prosocial action.

Maternal attributions and expressed emotion as predictors of attendance at parent management training,2005,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00365.x,96,"The effectiveness of parent management training (PMT) as a treatment for child behaviour problems is reduced by high attrition rates. One difficulty with engaging mothers is that, by definition, PMT is directed at the parent, yet many parents believe the cause of the problem lies within the child. Hence the model of therapy offered contradicts their understanding about the cause and nature of the problem. Moreover, the emotional consequence of holding child-responsibility causal attributions is associated with high expressed emotion (EE), a known predictor of poor compliance with therapy in other child psychiatric disorders.Seventy-five consecutive referrals of mothers to a PMT programme were recruited. EE was assessed using the Camberwell Family Interview methodology. Spontaneous causal attributions about their child's problem behaviour were collected from the same interview material and independently coded using the Leeds Attributional Coding System. Attendance data at the PMT programme was collected following completion of programmes.Contrary to expectations, mothers who made child-responsibility attributions and were highly critical about their child's behaviour were no more likely than non-blaming, low EE parents to drop out prematurely from a course of PMT. However, expressing an understanding of their own role in managing their child's behaviour was predictive of attendance. Two factors were, however, more closely associated with greater attrition: having been offered a clinical diagnosis and being from a lower socio-economic family.Socio-economic factors should be viewed as barriers to uptake of services and successful strategies for increasing engagement of families are likely to be economical rather than psychological. However, although the causal attributions mothers make about their child's behaviour did not predict whether they were likely to attend PMT, an exploratory analysis found evidence to suggest that successful engagement with PMT begins early i","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Attendance', 'Attrition', 'Parent training', 'Developmental psychology', 'Expressed emotion', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Medicine', 'Dentistry', 'Economics', 'Economic growth']","['Sarah Peters', 'Rachel Calam', 'Richard Harrington']",63,False,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,[],1,92.47264182611615,0.0012628754094478867,0.3333333333333333,0.1008840127866135

Method A total of 46 out-patients diagnosed with BD, 49 with SZ, and 50 healthy controls were assessed in attributional style (Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire), facial emotion recognition (FEIT, FEDT, ER-40), and ToM (Hinting Task). Symptomatology, clinical variables and global functioning were also collected. Results Both groups with SZ and BD showed hostile social cognitive biases, compared with the control group. Patients with BD also showed a capacity for emotional recognition similar to those with SZ and worse than control subjects. In contrast, patients with SZ showed poorer ToM. Subthreshold depressive symptoms and an attributional style toward hostility appeared as the factors with a strongest association to global functioning in BD. In SZ, PANSS score and a tendency to aggressiveness were the most relevant factors. Conclusion Attributional style (along with other domains of social cognition) is altered in out-patients with BD and SZ. The presence of residual symptoms and a hostile social cognitive bias may contribute to the functional impairment of both groups.","['Hostility', 'Psychology', 'Social cognition', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Theory of mind', 'Attribution', 'Cognition', 'Bipolar disorder', 'Clinical psychology', 'Attribution bias', 'Social functioning', 'Psychiatry', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Distress']","['Guillermo Lahera', 'Sara Herrera', 'María Reinares', 'Adolfo Benito', 'M.

The results revealed that brief mindfulness meditation enhanced both mental state attribution and empathic concern, compared to participants in the control group.

As predicted, the youngest children in the sample had a specific difficulty with identifying self-presentational motives. Importantly, the children's performance on control stories demonstrated that this was not likely to reflect difficulty with reasoning about others' beliefs. In Experiment 2, work with a further 48 children showed that even among children who clearly had the mental-state reasoning skills required for understanding others' beliefs about the self, there remained variability in the identification of self-presentational motives that was associated with variability in the attribution of embarrassment to story characters.

Pupils’ causal attributions for difficult classroom behaviour,2000,https://doi.org/10.1348/000709900157985,93,"Studies of causal attributions within educational contexts have tended to concentrate on academic performance. There have been a smaller number of investigations of teachers' attributions for pupils' behaviour in school.The present study examines the causal attribution made by pupils for difficult behaviour in classrooms. It reveals the structure of these attributions and serves as a comparison with the teacher studies.The participants were 105 pupils (52 males and 53 females) in the first year of secondary schooling, all drawn from the same inner city school.Four initial small group interviews were used to identify a wide range of factors that pupils viewed as being causes of difficult classroom behaviour in the 18 primary schools they had previously attended. A questionnaire was then constructed incorporating items from these discussions and administered to the whole of the year group of pupils, but omitting the participants in the initial group discussions.The results of a factor analysis indicated that pupils' attributions for misbehaviour at school were best represented by four factors: (1) 'fairness of teacher's actions', (2) 'pupil vulnerability', (3) 'adverse family circumstances' and (4) 'strictness of classroom regime'.

The Use of Secular and Religious Attributions to Explain Everyday Behavior,1992,https://doi.org/10.2307/1386858,92,"Attribution researchers, in focusing almost exclusively on people's secular explanations of behavior, have tended to neglect the role of religious concepts in the attribution process. This experiment tested a series of hypotheses, all emanating from the availability hypothesis (Spilka et al. 1985), concerning factors that affect the use of religious and secular attributions. A total of 183 subjects who varied in their commitment to the tenets of conservative Christianity were presented a series of vignettes describing everyday behavior and were asked to attribute the behavior to religious causal agents (God, Satan) or to secular causal agents (chance, dispositional, or situational factors). The results confirmed several hypotheses about attributions to God and Satan, but none of the hypotheses about the use of secular factors. Even so, subjects relied much more heavily on secular than on religious explanations of everyday behavior. The pattern of results suggests that the explanatory system underlying religious attributions might exemplify a multiple necessary schema rather than a multiple sufficient schema (Kelley 1972).","['Attribution', 'Sociology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology']","['Michael B.

Specifically, the study examines the role of attribution (or brand blame) and information characteristics in Chinese consumers’ responses to negative publicity. Design/methodology/approach The study used a quasi-experimental approach involving two negative publicity scenarios (mild and high severity) and a sample of 203 young and educated Chinese consumers. Partial least squares was used to test the hypotheses. Findings A common assumption is that negative brand information has a negative influence on all aspects of a brand. However, this study finds that brand blame and information severity have differential effects on consumer evaluations of the affected brand. Specifically, brand blame negatively impacted attitudes and purchase intentions, but not brand image. In contrast, information severity negatively impacted brand image, but not attitudes or intentions. Further, the relations between brand image and brand attitudes and intentions depended on the level of information severity. In the mild-severity condition, brand image positively influenced attitudes and intentions, but not in the high-severity condition. Research limitations/implications Future research should examine consumer responses to negative publicity across different media and product categories. Cross-cultural studies should also be explored in the future. Practical implications When a brand encounters negative publicity, its marketer or brand manager should assess to what extent various brand equity components are influenced by negative publicity before adopting any cognitive-based or imagery-based communication strategies.

A series of studies on peer-directed aggression that was guided by the attributional framework is presented. Among the topics examined are: (a) the cognitive and socialization antecedents of aggressive boys' beliefs about others' responsibility, (b) their understanding of impression management strategies that individuals use to alter perceptions of responsibility, and (c) an intervention approach with aggressive African American boys that is designed to change biased perceptions about others' responsibility for negative outcomes. New findings on achievement values among African American adolescents that also fit within the attributional conception are then presented.

Learning Stylometric Representations for Authorship Analysis,2017,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2017.2766189,90,"Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of authors from textual data.

The process is essential for various areas, such as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc. However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been shown to be scenario- or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for AA. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets.

The paper summarises the author's research on these topics, shows how they have contributed to furthering our understanding of organisational behaviour, suggests where research in these areas are going, and draws some conclusions for management practice.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Perception', 'Emotional intelligence', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Emotion perception', 'Face (sociological concept)', 'Quality (philosophy)', 'Affective science', 'Emotion classification', 'Emotion work', 'Sociology', 'Epistemology', 'Social science', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience']",['Neal M.

Across two studies, we integrate classic and recent theoretical work on attributions to understand the causal explanations underlying employee perceptions of and reactions to abusive supervision. In the first study, we develop measures of internal, external, and relational attributions for perceived supervisor abuse. In the second study, we demonstrate that internal and external attributions are indirectly related to aggressive and citizenship behaviors through employees' perceptions of interactional justice.

"Attention, theory of mind, and causal attributions in people with persecutory delusions: A preliminary investigation",2003,https://doi.org/10.1080/135468000057,88,"Abnormal attributions and deficits in theory of mind (ToM) skills have been implicated in paranoid delusions. Bentall and Kinderman (1998) have proposed that ToM deficits tend to prevent individuals from making situational attributions and therefore increase the probability of external-personal attributions, which in turn lead to paranoid beliefs. They further suggested that more fundamental information-processing deficits, by affecting theory of mind skills, increase the probability of paranoid attributions.Relationships between attention, ToM and attributions were assessed in acute and remitted paranoid patients and normal controls. Participants performed the digit span with distraction task, false belief and deception tasks, and a measure of attributional style.Compared to the controls, acute patients were distractible, performed poorly on ToM, and made more attributions that were judged external-personal by independent raters (but not as judged by self-ratings). ToM scores predicted the number of external-personal attributions as expected, but the effect of distraction on ToM was equivocal.Preliminary support was found for the hypotheses, but further studies are required using a range of executive, attentional, ToM, and attribution measures.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Theory of mind', 'Distraction', 'Social cognition', 'Paranoia', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Mentalization', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Fiona Randall', 'Rhiannon Corcoran', 'J.P.

Results revealed that secure people reported less maladaptive attributions than insecure people.

Attributions made for self‐ and partner behaviors overlapped to a great extent, implying an attributional style underlying this unique response pattern.

The theory proposes that applicants' affective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions, such as fairness, test perceptions, test performance, and motivation, are fundamentally driven by an attributional process. A key implication of the theory is that perceptions such as fairness and test attitudes carry little explanatory power; instead they are consequences of attributional processing. We provide a brief review of dominant applicant reactions frameworks, review the social psychological literature on attributions, and present the theory. We then contrast the theory to existing conceptualizations, and finally describe its potential for better understanding several key topics in applicant reactions, including the justice judgment process, test performance, and racial subgroup differences. The theory has the potential to integrate many diverse perspectives on applicant reactions, and provides numerous directions for future research and practice.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Perception', 'Explanatory power', 'Cognition', 'Test (biology)', 'Economic Justice', 'Process (computing)', 'Attribution bias', 'Information processing theory', 'Social cognition', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Information processing', 'Epistemology', 'Law', 'Paleontology', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience', 'Political science', 'Computer science', 'Biology', 'Operating system']","['Robert E.

"Attributions of personality based on physical appearance, speech, and handwriting.",1986,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.50.4.792,86,"The effect of facial appearance, speech style, and handwriting on personality attributions was examined. The source consistency hypothesis predicted that an actor will receive consistent attributions across all three types of information. The differential information hypothesis predicted that different personality dimensions are used to differentiate the actors within each type of information. In a 3 X 6 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) design, each judge rated a single actor/information combination on scales of social evaluation, intellectual evaluation, activity, potency, emotionality, and sociability. Photographs of actors were differentiated primarily in terms of positive social and intellectual evaluation; the speech of actors was differentiated primarily along an activity dimension; and the writing of the actors was differentiated primarily along a potency dimension. This study supported the differential information hypothesis and suggested that these three types of information about an actor may lead judges to use different personality dimensions. Person perception studies have shown that observers readily make attributions about the personality traits, abilities, and emotions of other persons based on limited information. Three types of information have been extensively studied: facial appearance, expressive noncontent characteristics of speech (such as pitch, tone, and tempo), and handwriting.

Impact of Salesperson Attraction on Sales Managers’ Attributions and Feedback,1996,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224299606000204,86,"The authors develop a model of how a salesperson's task and social attraction affect a sales manager's causal attributions explaining the salesperson's poor performance and the manager's corrective feedback based on these attributions. The authors’ experimental results, based on a sample of 218 sales managers, suggest that (1) causal attributions, cognitive effort, and decision confidence are directly affected by task and social attraction; (2) the effects of task and social attraction on coercive feedback are mediated by internal attributions; and (3) external attributions play a partial, but negative, mediating role for nonpunitve feedback. The authors also find evidence that interpersonal affect directly influences manager feedback. Implications for research and practice are developed that recognize that appraisal processes are influenced by affect and attributional considerations, not simply bias and inaccuracy in rating performance itself.","['Attribution', 'Attraction', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Task (project management)', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Interpersonal attraction', 'Cognition', 'Management', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Communication', 'Neuroscience', 'Economics']","['Thomas E.

Misattribution of facial expressions of emotion in adolescents at increased risk of psychosis: the role of inhibitory control,2010,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291710000929,86,"Background By studying behavior, cognitive abilities and brain functioning in adolescents at high risk for psychosis, we can gain an insight into the vulnerability markers or protective factors in the development of psychotic symptoms. Although many high-risk studies have focused on impairments in neurocognitive functions, such as memory and attention, very few studies have investigated problems in processing social cues such as facial expressions as a possible vulnerability marker for psychosis. Method Thirty-six adolescents at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and 21 non-clinical controls completed a face recognition test, a facial affect labeling test and an inhibitory control test. Schizotypal traits and schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using a schizotypy questionnaire and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results The UHR group showed impairments in labeling facial expressions of others, in addition to a spared ability to recognize facial identity. More specifically, the UHR group made more errors in labeling neutral expressions compared to the controls, and an analysis of error types indicated that neutral faces were misattributed as being angry. The degree of misattribution of neutral-as-angry faces correlated significantly with reduced inhibitory control. Conclusions Our findings suggest that misattributing social cues might contribute to vulnerability for psychosis. This social cognitive deficit may be related to problems in inhibitory control, which potentially plays an important role in the selection of appropriate social meaning. These findings may have relevance for understanding the mechanisms underlying prodromal social dysfunction, which should be targeted in future remediation interventions.","['Schizotypy', 'Psychology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Misattribution of memory', 'Psychosis', 'Facial expression', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Social cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Communication']","['Sophie van Rijn', 'André Alemán', 'Leo de Sonneville', 'M.

Understanding the Intentions Behind Man-Made Products Elicits Neural Activity in Areas Dedicated to Mental State Attribution,2008,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhn110,86,"Trying to understand others is the most pervasive aspect of successful social interaction. To date there is no evidence on whether human products, which signal the workings of a mind in the absence of an explicit agent, also reliably engage neural structures typically associated with mental state attribution. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging the present study shows that when subjects believe they are listening to a piece of music that was written by a composer (i.e., human product) as opposed to generated by a computer (i.e., nonhuman product), activations in the cortical network typically reported for mental state attribution (anterior medial frontal cortex [aMFC]), superior temporal sulcus, and temporal poles) were observed. The activation in the aMFC correlated highly with the extent to which subjects had engaged in attributing the expression of intentions to the composed pieces, as indicated in a postimaging questionnaire. We interpret these findings as indicative of automatic mechanisms, which reflect mental state attribution in the face of any stimulus that potentially signals the working of another mind and conclude that even in the absence of a socially salient stimulus, our environment is still populated by the indirect social signals inherent to human artifacts.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Theory of mind', 'Active listening', 'Superior temporal sulcus', 'Mental state', 'Neural correlates of consciousness', 'Cognition', 'Social cognition', 'Neuroscience', 'Cognitive science', 'Social psychology', 'Communication']","['Nikolaus Steinbeis', 'Stefan Koelsch']",25,True,Cerebral Cortex,[],1,91.4175897952333,0.0011313258876303985,0.3333333333333333,0.10079192812134127
Does Biology Justify Ideology? The Politics of Genetic Attribution,2012,https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfs049,85,"Conventional wisdom suggests that political conservatives are more likely than liberals to endorse genetic explanations for many human characteristics and behaviors. Whether and to what extent this is true has received surprisingly limited systematic attention. We examine evidence from a large U.S. public opinion survey that measured the extent to which respondents believed genetic explanations account for a variety of differences among individuals as well as groups in society. We find that conservatives were indeed more likely than liberals to endorse genetic explanations for perceived race and class differences in characteristics often associated with socioeconomic inequality (intelligence, math skills, drive, and violence). Different ideological divisions emerged, however, with respect to respondents' explanations for sexual orientation. Here, liberals were more likely than conservatives to say that sexual orientation is due to genes and less likely to say that it is due to choice or the environment. These patterns suggest that conservative and liberal ideologues will tend to endorse genetic explanations where their policy positions are bolstered by ""naturalizing"" human differences. That said, debates over genetic influence may be more politicized with respect to race, class, and sexual orientation than population differences generally: We find that left/right political ideology was not significantly associated with genetic (or other) attributions for individual differences in intelligence, math skills, drive, or violence. We conclude that conceptions of the proper role of government are closely intertwined with assumptions about the causes of human difference, but that this relationship is a complex one.","['Ideology', 'Biology and political orientation', 'Sexual orientation', 'Race (biology)', 'Politics', 'Attribution', 'Population', 'Social psychology', 'Public opinion', 'Socioeconomic status', 'Heredity', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Political science', 'Positive economics', 'Gender studies', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Law', 'Demography', 'Economics']","['Elizabeth Suhay', 'Toby Epstein Jayaratne']",69,False,Public Opinion Quarterly,[],1,91.28801611278952,0.0011181709354486497,0.3333333333333333,0.10078271965481404

"Corpus Stylistics, Stylometry, and the Styles of Henry James",2007,,85,"1. Introduction They would dine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old Waymarsh--if not even, for that matter, to himself--there was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other. The beginning of Henry James's The Ambassadors is sufficient to explain why There has never been any doubt that he had a 'style' (Lodge 189). And the obvious artifice of sentences like the one above, from its famous first paragraph, have helped to establish James as an exceptionally self-conscious stylist. Furthermore, although change must be expected in the style of any author with a career spanning forty years, the stylistic differences between James's novels of the 1870's and those written after 1900 have long been considered extreme. Shortly after James' s death, Carl Van Doren asserted that the style of early novels like The American, The Europeans, Daisy Miller, Washington Square, or The Portrait of a Lady is quite different from the obscure late style that some readers dislike (18). Traditionally, the distinctiveness of James's late style has been attributed primarily to his sometimes convoluted and self-interruptive syntax. R. W. Short notes that James's syntactic distortions often obliterate the normal elements of connection and cohesion. When he has undone the usual ties, his meanings float untethered, grammatically speaking, like particles in colloidal suspension (73-4). Ian Watt's well-known explication of the first paragraph of The Ambassadors also memorably discusses the syntax (442-55), as do Richard Ohmann (274-5), and Leech and Short (100-1) (see also my Altered Texts 110-13). Other critics have pointed out some non-syntactic alterations James made in his revisions of his early novels for New York edition; for example, more explicit and precise lexis, more figures of speech, more varied and. elaborate speech markers, more contractions and colloquialisms, and more adverbial modifiers.

Causal attributions about common somatic sensations among frequent general practice attenders,1996,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291700035716,84,"The causal attributions that people make about bodily symptoms or sensations are likely to influence their decisions whether or not to consult a doctor. Previous research has supported the model that people tend initially to look for external or environmental explanations for bodily sensations (normalizing attributions) and only if this process fails do they search for attributions internal to themselves (somatic or psychological attributions). This study tested two hypotheses about frequent general practice attenders: (1) compared with others, they are more likely to make somatic attributions and less likely to make normalizing ones; and (2) given a bodily symptom together with a somatic explanation, frequent attenders will have greater difficulty than others in finding reasons why the given (pathological) explanation is untrue. The frequent attenders' group had themselves initiated an average of 12 general practice visits in the 12 months before assessment, while a control group of infrequent attenders had not made appointments to see their general practitioner for an average of 24 months. The results provide partial support for the hypotheses. Frequent attenders generated significantly fewer normalizing explanations for a series of common bodily sensations than the comparison group, although the two groups did not differ in their somatic attributions. Given a common bodily sensation and an accompanying pathological explanation, the frequent attenders were less able than the control group to generate reasons why the given explanation might be untrue.

The Pragmatic American: Attributions of Crime and the Hydraulic Relation Hypothesis,2009,https://doi.org/10.1080/07418820902855362,84,"Abstract Attribution theory argues that a ""hydraulic relation"" exists between dispositional and situational attribution styles, causing people to endorse one style at the expense of the other. That is, attribution theorists predict that there should be a strong negative relationship between attribution styles. We test this prediction using data collected in Hillsborough County (Tampa), Florida, and two national polls. Our investigation shows that, rather than a bifurcated view of crime causation, Americans manifest a complex attributional style that views crime emerging from multiple sources. We discuss how these findings reveal that the American public tends to be not ideological but pragmatic in its view of crime causation and, ultimately, in the crime control policies it is willing to endorse. Keywords: public opinionattribution theorypunitiveness Notes 1. Our focus here is in exploring the alleged sharp distinctions that have been portrayed by those who endorse a dispositional attribution style—a punitive approach to crime—versus those who embrace a situational attribution style. We are not dismissing the fact that there are other pointed cleavages in public opinion when citizens are queried about crime. For example, Unnever, Cullen, and Jonson (Citation2008) show that there are sharp racial divisions in support for the death penalty; the majority of African Americans oppose whereas the majority of whites support capital punishment. 2. Choi et al. (Citation1999) highlight numerous reasons why Westerners such as those in the USA tend to gravitate toward a dispositional attribution style when compared to their Eastern counterparts. For example, they argue that Easterners are more sensitive to situational influences on behavior and view the group as the natural unit of agency whereas Westerners tend to view the individual as the unit of agency and tend to discount situational influences on behavior. However, scholars have called into question the argument that cult","['Attribution', 'Relation (database)', 'Criminology', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'Database']","['James D.

A critique of neo-Hahnian outdoor education theory. Part two: “The fundamental attribution error” in contemporary outdoor education discourse,2003,https://doi.org/10.1080/14729670385200311,84,"Abstract In the first of a two part series of articles I argued that ""character building"" in outdoor adventure education (OAE) is a flawed concept. This, the second article, examines the persistence of the idea of character building in OAE in the face of strong evidence that outdoor experiences cannot change personal traits. I examine how the ""fundamental attribution error"" can explain the paradox of (a) a shortage of evidence that adventure education ""works"" and (b) a widespread belief that it does ""work"". I review the place of character building in research, and develop a critical reading of a representative adventure education text. I show how unchallenged dispositionist assumptions emerge in neo-Hahnian discourse. I explain how discarding the intuitively appealing but fallacious foundations of neo-Hahnism can clear the way for situationist approaches to outdoor education that bring much needed sensitivity to cultural, regional, historical, and social contexts.","['Situationism', 'Adventure education', 'Adventure', 'Sociology', 'Outdoor education', 'Attribution', 'Character (mathematics)', 'Epistemology', 'Reading (process)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Aesthetics', 'Pedagogy', 'Linguistics', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Geometry', 'Mathematics', 'Art history']",['Andrew Brookes'],35,False,Journal of Adventure Education & Outdoor Learning,[],1,91.1698556562605,0.0011050159832669008,0.3333333333333333,0.10077351118828683

Method: 88 participants completed five questionnaires: Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ in both positive and negative situations), Bradburn Affect Scales (Positive Affect, Negative Affect, and Affect Balance Scale), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Gurin Happiness Measure, and Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI). Results: regressional analysis showed that the ASQ was the significant predictor of happiness accounting for 18% of variance. The ASQ in positive and negative situations was significantly inversely correlated with self-esteem. Further, with happiness (the OHI) as dependent variable and attributional style, self-esteem, and demographic variables as independent variables, self-esteem and attributional style (in positive situations) were the significant predictors of happiness accounting for 55% of the total variance. Conclusion: the results indicated that optimistic attributional style in positive situations was a stronger predictor of self-reported happiness than optimistic attributional style in negative situations. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of cognitive strategies for changing pessimism into optimism thus enhancing happiness or psychological well-being.","['Happiness', 'Psychology', 'Optimism', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Pessimism', 'Self-esteem', 'Subjective well-being', 'Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Scale (ratio)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Communication', 'Epistemology', 'Quantum mechanics']","['Helen Cheng', 'Adrian Furnham']",0,False,Counselling Psychology Quarterly,[],1,91.05001678415576,0.001091861031085152,0.3333333333333333,0.1007643027217596
What causes problems in Alzheimer's disease: attributions by caregivers. A qualitative study,2004,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.1118,83,"Abstract Objective To gain insight into caregivers' understanding of the causes of behaviours they find problematic in people with Alzheimer's disease in order to inform the development of educational strategies. Methods A qualitative, semi‐structured interview was used. Participants were 205 caregivers for a person with Alzheimer's disease, all of whom were aware of the diagnosis and who had been recruited as part of a larger longitudinal study. Participants were from inner‐city and suburban London/semi‐rural Essex. The main outcome measures were caregivers' understanding of: the cause of problematic behaviour; the ability of the person with dementia to control this behaviour; the prognosis of the illness. Results Most carers attribute the cognitive, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia to causes other than dementia; many believe that the person with dementia has control over their behaviour and substantial numbers believe the person with dementia will return to normal. Conclusions This study suggests that providing facts about the illness to caregivers is not enough, as caregivers may not understand that the symptoms they observe are related to the diagnosis. Education by clinicians should focus on the understanding of caregivers and in particular explore the caregivers' attributions of the symptoms which are present in the person for whom they care.

This study investigated the relationship between level of depressive symptoms and general attributional or explanatory style in 33 adolescents with Asperger syndrome.

The more depressive symptoms the adolescents reported, the more the adolescents explained negative events by internal, stable, and global causes. One third of the participants obtained scores on the Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire composite for positive events that are considered to be suggestive of a very pessimistic, failure-prone style. However, only 9% of the participants rated themselves as having substantially more depressive symptoms than peers on the Children's Depression Inventory. Given that 70% of the participants were taking medication for depression, these findings may suggest that the medication controlled depressive symptoms but did not affect the maladaptive attributional style.

"Staff reactions to self‐injurious behaviours in learning disability services: Attributions, emotional responses and helping",2003,https://doi.org/10.1348/014466503321903599,83,"The aim of the study was to explore an amended version of Weiner's (e.g. Weiner, 1980) helping behaviour model potentially more specific to the context of care staff working with people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours.Key elements of the helping model (causal attributions, affective responses, and helping behaviour) were assessed using self-report questionnaires. In contrast to previous research, helping behaviour was conceptualized as behaviour more or less likely to reinforce challenging behaviours rather than as willingness to expend extra effort in helping. Furthermore, dimensions of positive and negative affect associated with challenging behaviour were used.A total of 123 care staff in adult services viewed one of two videos depicting a person with learning disabilities engaging in self-injurious behaviour. Information about the behaviour's function was manipulated in order to assess reinforcing staff helping responses. Staff completed self-report scales immediately after viewing the video material.There was very little evidence for the predicted associations between causal attributions and both positive and negative affect, and only one significant association between affect and reinforcing helping responses. Given this lack of association, we did not fully test Weiner's prediction that affect would mediate the impact of causal attributions on helping.We found no evidence that Weiner's helping model can be amended to account for staff working with challenging behaviour. Close examination of previous studies also reveals very few supportive data of Weiner's original formulation. Therefore, we discuss the potential utility of alternative models in addition to methodological and conceptual issues.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Helping behavior', 'Association (psychology)', 'Social psychology', 'Learning disability', 'Challenging behaviour', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Paleontology', 'Communication', 'Biology']","['Cheryl Jones', 'Richard P.

Method Outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder ( n = 73) and healthy controls ( n = 30) performed a computerised Facial Emotion Attribution Test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Patients were also rated on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results Patients were poor at recognizing fearful and angry emotions and attributed fear to angry and angry to neutral expressions. Fear-as-anger misattributions were predicted independently by a longer duration of illness and WCST perseverative errors. Conclusion The findings show a bias towards misattributing fearful and angry facial emotions. The propensity for fear-as-anger misattribution biases increases as the length of time that the disorder is experienced increases and a more rigid style of information processing is used. This, at least in part, may be perpetuated by subtle fearfulness expressed by others while interacting with people with schizophrenia.","['Misattribution of memory', 'Schizoaffective disorder', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Psychology', 'Audiology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Medicine', 'Psychosis', 'Cognition']","['Preethi Premkumar', 'Michael A.

Who's to blame? Narcissism and self‐serving attributions following feedback,2003,https://doi.org/10.1002/per.497,83,"The study examined the relationship between narcissism, performance attributions, and negative emotions following success or failure. As expected, narcissistic individuals showed more self‐serving attributions for their performance in an intelligence test than less narcissistic individuals: compared with less narcissistic individuals, narcissists revealed a stronger tendency to attribute success to ability and failure to task difficulty. In contrast to this, less narcissistic participants tended to show the opposite pattern by ascribing failure, but not success, to their ability. Additionally, anger and depression could be predicted by an interaction of performance feedback and performance attributions. Mediation analyses revealed that the attribution dimensions ‘task difficulty’ and ‘ability’ mediated the effect of narcissism on anger and depression following failure feedback. The results provide support for the theoretical assumption that attributional processes might, at least to some extent, explain the often reported relation between narcissism and negative emotions following failure.

Path analyses in both studies generally supported predictions derived from Weiner's model; the association between perceived controllability, intentionality, and dispositional locus of causality of the negative driving event and subsequent anger was mediated by perceptions of responsibility.Additional results in Study 2 suggested that low perceived controllability, intentionality, and dispositional locus of causality were associated with reduced perceived responsibility, which, in turn, facilitated feelings of sympathy.Anger was associated with aggressive responses to the offending driver, whereas sympathy was associated with prosocial responses.Recommendations were offered for improved driver safety, including the development of attributional retraining programs to combat selfserving attributional biases, teaching novice drivers about both formal and informal roadway communication, and the promotion of forgiveness among drivers.","['Psychology', 'Sympathy', 'Attribution', 'Anger', 'Social psychology', 'Feeling', 'Prosocial behavior', 'Aggression', 'Perception', 'Neuroscience']","['Christine M.

Authorship Attribution Through Function Word Adjacency Networks,2015,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2015.2451111,81,"A method for authorship attribution based on function word adjacency networks (WANs) is introduced. Function words are parts of speech that express grammatical relationships between other words but do not carry lexical meaning on their own. In the WANs in this paper, nodes are function words and directed edges from a source function word to a target function word stand in for the likelihood of finding the latter in the ordered vicinity of the former. WANs of different authors can be interpreted as transition probabilities of a Markov chain and are therefore compared in terms of their relative entropies. Optimal selection of WAN parameters is studied and attribution accuracy is benchmarked across a diverse pool of authors and varying text lengths. This analysis shows that, since function words are independent of content, their use tends to be specific to an author and that the relational data captured by function WANs is a good summary of stylometric fingerprints. Attribution accuracy is observed to exceed the one achieved by methods that rely on word frequencies alone. Further combining WANs with methods that rely on word frequencies, results in larger attribution accuracy, indicating that both sources of information encode different aspects of authorial styles.","['Computer science', 'Adjacency list', 'Word (group theory)', 'Natural language processing', 'Attribution', 'Function (biology)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Markov chain', 'Part of speech', 'Speech recognition', 'Mathematics', 'Algorithm', 'Machine learning', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Biology', 'Geometry', 'Evolutionary biology']","['Santiago Segarra', 'Mark Eisen', 'Alejandro Ribeiro']",61,False,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,[],1,90.80664652567975,0.0010655511267216543,0.3333333333333333,0.10074588578870515
Celebrity Scandal Fallout: How Attribution Style Can Protect the Sponsor,2013,https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.20625,81,"ABSTRACT An attribution is an inference about why an event occurred or about a person's disposition or other psychological state. This study is designed to examine the effects of consumers’ attribution styles (i.e., dispositional and situational) and moderating role of celebrity identification and brand commitment in the evaluation of negative information about a celebrity endorser. The study finds that people who make dispositional attributions judge the endorsed brand more negatively than do those who make situational attributions. The findings also suggest that consumers with a higher level of identification with the celebrity are less likely to react negatively to the bad publicity. Finally, the study found that, when faced with a celebrity scandal, people with high brand commitment showed more favorable attitudes toward the brand as well as higher purchase intention than those with low brand commitment.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Social psychology', 'Publicity', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Advertising', 'Identification (biology)', 'Marketing', 'Business', 'Botany', 'Archaeology', 'Biology', 'History']",['Nam‐Hyun Um'],63,False,Psychology and Marketing,[],1,90.80664652567975,0.0010655511267216543,0.3333333333333333,0.10074588578870515

Restricted Emotional Processing and Somatic Attribution in Fibromyalgia,2001,https://doi.org/10.2190/k7au-9ux9-w8bw-tetl,81,"Objective: Medically unexplained symptoms or syndromes, such as fibromyalgia (FM), might be partly caused or sustained by a mechanism involving restricted emotional processing (REP) and the subsequent attribution of emotional arousal to somatic or syndrome-consistent causes. In this study, it was hypothesized that FM patients, compared to healthy individuals, would be higher on trait measures of REP (defensiveness and alexithymia), and would show affective-autonomic response dissociation, that is, higher standardized scores of heart rate responses than affective responses, during negative emotional stimulation. Additionally, FM patients were expected to attribute their bodily symptoms more to somatic than to psychological causes. Method: Emotional movie excerpts were shown to 16 female FM patients and 17 healthy women. Affective response and heart rate were monitored continuously, while symptoms and their causal attributions were measured before and after the excerpts. Repressor coping style and alexithymia were measured, along with negative affectivity and habitual attributions of somatic complaints. Results: FM patients nearly all showed the relatively uncommon combination of high defensiveness and high anxiousness. Compared with healthy women FM patients were more alexithymic, showed a higher level of affective-autonomic response dissociation, and lower within-subject emotional variability. The groups showed opposite attributional patterns, with FM patients attributing symptoms less to psychological causes and more to somatic causes. There was no evidence of a shift in these attributions caused by the emotional stimuli. Conclusions: The results provide preliminary support for the hypotheses. Both at trait and at state level, FM showed restricted emotional processing on most of the parameters measured, and a high ratio of somatic to psychological symptom attribution, coupled with high negative affectivity.","['Alexithymia', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Somatization', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Trait', 'Heart rate', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Heart rate variability', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Internal medicine', 'Blood pressure', 'Neuroscience', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['J.

"Authorial attribution and computational stylistics: if you can tell authors apart, have you learned anything about them?",1999,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/14.1.103,81,"Within stylometrics, the disciplines of authorial attribution and descriptive stylistics hitherto have been pursued separately. The first has achieved mainstream status within literary studies, while the second is little recognized. A study of the plays of Thomas Middleton compared with a large control sample shows that it is possible to achieve a good classification of his work in 2,000 word segments as against those of his contemporaries, using frequencies of very common words. Such a result can serve as the basis both for testing Middleton's hand in some disputed plays and for a description of his style. Most of «The Revenger's Tragedy», part of «The Yorkshire Tragedy», and all of «The Second Maiden's Tragedy» prove to be in a style similar to that of Middleton's uncontested plays. This style, judging by an examination of instances in context of the ten word types most strongly correlated with the Middleton-other discriminant function, is (among other things) rich in deictics and poor in conjunctions, features readily accommodated to previous descriptions including Middleton's own. It is concluded that classification and description can be mutually supportive: the first confirms the validity of the second, while the second helps to establish the stylistic mechanism underlying a successful classification.","['Stylistics', 'Attribution', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'History', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology']",['Hugh Craig'],0,False,Literary and Linguistic Computing,[],1,90.80664652567975,0.0010655511267216543,0.3333333333333333,0.10074588578870515

Source attributions of pollution to the Western Arctic during the NASA ARCTAS field campaign,2013,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-4707-2013,81,"Abstract. We use the NASA GEOS-5 transport model with tagged tracers to investigate the contributions of different regional sources of CO and black carbon (BC) to their concentrations in the Western Arctic (i.e., 50–90° N and 190–320° E) in spring and summer 2008. The model is evaluated by comparing the results with airborne measurements of CO and BC from the NASA Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) field campaigns to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of our simulations. We also examine the reliability of tagged CO tracers in characterizing air mass origins using the measured fossil fuel tracer of dichloromethane and the biomass burning tracer of acetonitrile. Our tagged CO simulations suggest that most of the enhanced CO concentrations (above background level from CH4 production) observed during April originate from Asian anthropogenic emissions. Boreal biomass burning emissions and Asian anthropogenic emissions are of similar importance in July domain wise, although the biomass burning CO fraction is much larger in the area of the ARCTAS field experiments. The fraction of CO from Asian anthropogenic emissions is larger in spring than in summer. European sources make up no more than 10% of CO levels in the campaign domain during either period. Comparisons of CO concentrations along the flight tracks with regional averages from GEOS-5 show that the along-track measurements are representative of the concentrations within the large domain of the Western Arctic in April but not in July.","['Environmental science', 'Arctic', 'Troposphere', 'Atmospheric sciences', 'TRACER', 'Boreal', 'Biomass burning', 'Air pollution', 'The arctic', 'Climatology', 'Oceanography', 'Meteorology', 'Aerosol', 'Geography', 'Chemistry', 'Geology', 'Physics', 'Archaeology', 'Organic chemistry', 'Nuclear physics']","['Huisheng Bian', 'Peter R.

However, although staff reported high stress levels and moderate burnout, this did not appear to relate to their reporting of thoughts and feelings regarding challenging behaviour predicted by Weiner's helping model. It was not possible to fully test the helping model, as the 'help' variable was not normally distributed.There was little evidence to suggest that stress has a primary role in determining staff responses when examined within Weiner's model of helping.

We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., maternal and child depression, maternal and child negative life events, marital conflict , socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make negative attributions and interact coercively. One hundred four mothers and sons (age 7–9 years) from married and divorced families participated. They completed questionnaire and interview data and were observed while participating in two gamelike tasks (e.g., Trouble, Etch-a-Sketch). Both maternal and child attributions were significantly related to their coercive interactions. The most aggressive dyads were those in which both mothers and sons perceived hostile intent in the other. The relations between attributions and coercive interactions were found to be moderated by marital conflict, and maternal education, such that the association between attributions and coercive behavior, was stronger when marital conflict was low and the mothers were better educated.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Socioeconomic status', 'Association (psychology)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Demography', 'Population', 'Sociology', 'Psychotherapist']","['Carol MacKinnon‐Lewis', 'Michael E.

Goal attribution to schematic animals: do 6‐month‐olds perceive biological motion as animate?,2009,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00854.x,80,"Infants are sensitive to biological motion, but do they recognize it as animate? As a first step towards answering this question, two experiments investigated whether 6-month-olds selectively attribute goals to shapes moving like animals. We habituated infants to a square moving towards one of two targets. When target locations were switched, infants reacted more to movement towards a new goal than a new location - but only if the square moved non-rigidly and rhythmically, in a schematic version of bio-mechanical movement older observers describe as animal-like (Michotte, 1963). Goal attribution was specific to schematic animal motion: It did not occur if the square moved rigidly with the same rhythm as the animate stimulus, or if the square had the same amount of non-rigid deformation, but in an inanimate configuration. The data would seem to show that perception of schematic animal motion is linked to a system for psychological reasoning from infancy. This in turn suggests that 6-month-olds may already interpret biological motion as animate.","['Biological motion', 'Schematic', 'Psychology', 'Motion (physics)', 'Attribution', 'Perception', 'Movement (music)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Communication', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive science', 'Neuroscience', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Electronic engineering', 'Engineering', 'Aesthetics']","['Anne Schlottmann', 'Elizabeth Ray']",42,False,Developmental Science,[],1,90.6847935548842,0.0010523961745399055,0.3333333333333333,0.10073667732217792

Materials and Methods 123 frontline staff in educational settings completed a modified version of the Attribution Questionnaire after reading a hypothetical vignette and completing a quiz on autism. Results Knowledge and experience were only significantly related to punitive behavioural intention towards children with autism. Anger and sympathy mediated the effect between perceived controllability on both helping and punitive behavioural intentions.

Specifically, it develops and assesses an extension of Weiner's attribution-emotion-intention model of helping (e.g., Weiner, 1995) to the prediction of support providers' goals. 608 college students read situations manipulating attributions of responsibility, stability, and effort with regard to a friend who was seeking support. They subsequently responded to measures of emotional response (anger, sympathy), interaction goals, and attributions. Attributions were found to influence goals both directly and through the mediation of emotion, though the character of this influence depended strongly on the goal. The results suggest that at least some variability in the effectiveness and sensitivity of supportive communication can be explained by support providers' goals.

It is hypothesized that consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence is moderated by the level of attributional sensitivity. Across two studies, this hypothesis was supported. Individuals high in attributional sensitivity scored higher on various measures of consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence than individuals low in attributional sensitivity. This suggests that consumers susceptible to the influence of others are more likely to purchase products that they perceive will lead others to make favorable attributions about them, and avoid purchasing products that they perceive will lead others to evaluate them negatively. © 1992 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Purchasing', 'Interpersonal influence', 'Social psychology', 'Sensitivity (control systems)', 'Interpersonal relationship', 'Marketing', 'Electronic engineering', 'Engineering', 'Business']","['Richard G.

Independent variables included measures of interpersonal trust, valuation of religion, and individualistic versus collective action attributions of responsibility for solving social problems. Interpersonal trust predicted four out of the five outcome variables. Individualistic attribution of social responsibility was a predictor of running for student government office, and collective action attribution was a predictor of conceptualizations of citizenship.

Validation of a new self-report measure of parental attributions.,2009,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0016331,76,"Attributional theory and empirical evidence suggest that a tendency to make stable, global self-causal attributions for undesirable events is associated with negative outcomes. However, existing self-report measures of parental attributions do not account for the possibility that dysfunctional parent-causal attributions for child misbehavior might be important predictors of poor family functioning. To address these concerns, the authors developed and tested a new measure of both parent-causal and child-responsible attributions for child misbehavior in a sample of 453 community couples. Structural validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, internal consistency, and temporal stability of the new measure were examined. As expected, confirmatory factor analysis resulted in 2 factors, Child-Responsible (9 items) and Parent-Causal (7 items); the final model was cross-validated in a holdout sample. The final scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency (alphas = .81-.90), test-retest reliability (rs = .55-.76), and convergent and discriminant validity. Dysfunctional parent-causal and child-responsible attributions significantly predicted parental emotional problems, ineffective discipline, parent-child physical aggression, and low parenting satisfaction. Associations with parent-child aggression and parenting satisfaction were generally larger than with partner aggression and relationship satisfaction.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Discriminant validity', 'Dysfunctional family', 'Convergent validity', 'Developmental psychology', 'Aggression', 'Confirmatory factor analysis', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Social psychology', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Internal consistency', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']","['Jeffery D.

Results indicated that attributional style is associated with multiple depression-related variables. In addition, youth experienced significant changes in their attributional styles over time (from adaptive to maladaptive and vice versa).

Effects of Perceived Control upon Wagering and Attributions in Computer Blackjack,1995,https://doi.org/10.1080/00221309.1995.9921237,75,"Abstract The effects of short-term fluctuations of odds and personal control upon risk-taking behavior in computer blackjack were examined. Although probabilistic models make clear recommendations about optimal play in blackjack (e.g., the basic strategy and card counting), players deviate from optimal play. Those deviations might be explainable by cognitive theories. Risk taking can be explained in terms of irrational cognitions and self-serving evaluations of outcomes; it can also be explained in terms of the available evidence used when people make their decisions. Twelve undergraduate students of the University of Hong Kong played computer blackjack for money. Fluctuations of short-term odds were manipulated as winning or losing streaks, the ability to request extra cards during play was considered to be control of a skill-relevant dimension, and the ability to choose ""dealers"" was considered to be control of a skill-irrelevant dimension. Recent successful outcomes and the ability to control the skill-relevant factor led to increases in bet size and to stronger self-serving bias in the attribution of the outcomes. Cognitive theories of risk taking that emphasize the evidence available for decisions were supported.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Odds', 'Control (management)', 'Cognition', 'Dimension (graph theory)', 'Irrational number', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Social psychology', 'Self-control', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Logistic regression', 'Geometry', 'Mathematics', 'Communication', 'Machine learning', 'Neuroscience', 'Pure mathematics']","['Albert W.

Charisma is also in the eye of the beholder—an attribute perceived by followers. Traditional leadership theory has tended to assume charismatic attributions flow to men rather than women. We challenge this assumption of an inevitable charismatic bias toward men leaders. We propose that gender-biased attributions about the charismatic leadership of men and women are facilitated by the operation of a leader-in-social-network schema. Attributions of charismatic leadership depend on the match between the gender of the leader and the perceived structure of the network. In three studies encompassing both experimental and survey data, we show that when team advice networks are perceived to be centralized around one or a few individuals, women leaders are seen as less charismatic than men leaders. However, when networks are perceived to be cohesive (many connections among individuals), it is men who suffer a charismatic leadership disadvantage relative to women. Perceptions of leadership depend not only on whether the leader is a man or a woman but also on the social network context in which the leader is embedded.","['Charisma', 'Social psychology', 'Charismatic authority', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Perception', 'Schema (genetic algorithms)', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Political science', 'Computer science', 'Communication', 'Neuroscience', 'Machine learning', 'Law']","['Raina A.

Dominance Attributions Following Damage to the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex,2004,https://doi.org/10.1162/0898929042947856,74,"Abstract Damage to the human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VM) can result in dramatic and maladaptive changes in social behavior despite preservation of most other cognitive abilities. One important aspect of social cognition is the ability to detect social dominance, a process of attributing from particular social signals another person's relative standing in the social world. To test the role of the VM in making attributions of social dominance, we designed two experiments: one requiring dominance judgments from static pictures of faces, the second requiring dominance judgments from film clips. We tested three demographically matched groups of subjects: subjects with focal lesions in the VM (n = 15), brain-damaged comparison subjects with lesions excluding the VM (n = 11), and a reference group of normal individuals with no history of neurological disease (n = 32). Contrary to our expectation, we found that subjects with VM lesions gave dominance judgments on both tasks that did not differ significantly from those given by the other groups. Despite their grossly normal performance, however, subjects with VM lesions showed more subtle impairments specifically when judging static faces: They were less discriminative in their dominance judgments, and did not appear to make normal use of gender and age of the faces in forming their judgments. The findings suggest that, in the laboratory tasks we used, damage to the VM does not necessarily impair judgments of social dominance, although it appears to result in alterations in strategy that might translate into behavioral impairments in real life.","['Psychology', 'Ventromedial prefrontal cortex', 'Dominance (genetics)', 'Prefrontal cortex', 'Attribution', 'Social cognition', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene']","['Matthew S.

An investigation of attributional style in first‐episode psychosis,1999,https://doi.org/10.1348/014466599162737,74,"Objective. The present study investigated covert and overt attributional styles in individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis. It was hypothesized that those individuals experiencing paranoia, as operationalized by higher scores on the suspiciousness item of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) would perform differently on both covert and overt measures of attributional style when compared to those individuals who scored lower on the BPRS suspiciousness item. Design and Methods. A cross‐sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 62 participants (50 males and 12 females) from the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre. The Pragmatic Inference Task (PIT) was used to measure covert attributional style, whereas the Attributional Style Questionnaire (parallel form; ASQpf) measured overt attributional style. The Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Questionnaire measured global self‐esteem. Participants positive, negative, and depressive symptoms were assessed by means of the BPRS, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. Results. Regression analyses found that less suspiciousness ( p =.02) and more depression ( p =.02) predicted higher internal attributions for negative events scores on the ASQpf. There was a trend ( p =.07) for more suspicious individuals to endorse the self‐serving bias (SSB) on the PIT, even despite the SSB not being large enough to be considered defensive. Verbal IQ emerged as a significant predictor of covert attributional style ( p =.04). Conclusions. The findings suggest that increasing suspiciousness does predict attributional style in the early stages of psychosis, although the relationship appears weaker than in reports with more chronic psychotic patient samples. Longitudinal research is needed to ascertain whether attributional style is a stable characteristic in psychosis, or whether it fluctuates between periods of remission and active psychosis.","['Psychology', 'Psychosis', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Archaeology', 'History']","['Helen Krstev', 'Henry J.

The Sequential and Distributional Structure of Conflict Interactions as a Function of Attributions Concerning the Locus of Responsibility and Stability of Conflicts,1980,https://doi.org/10.1080/23808985.1980.11923804,74,"This study examines the sequential and distributional structure of discussions involving college roommates. Subjects were videotaped discussing a series of conflict issues that typically occur among roommates. The subjects privately completed questionnaires prior to the discussions where they identified conflicts they had experienced with their roommates, rated their own responsibility and their roommate's responsibility for causing these conflicts, and rated the stability of the conflicts. Discussions were coded into three categories of conflict resolution behavior—avoidance, distributive, and integrative. The results replicated an earlier finding obtained from self-report data that attributions of responsibility to the partner increase avoidance and distributive conflict strategies and decrease integrative strategies. In addition, the sequential structure of the discussions was affected by attributions of responsibility and stability. Finally, actor–observer differences in attributions, typically found in attribution studies, were shown to depend on relationship satisfaction and the perceived importance of conflicts.","['Attribution', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Conflict resolution', 'Moral responsibility', 'Conflict resolution strategy', 'Function (biology)', 'Sociology', 'Political science', 'Social science', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Law', 'Biology']",['Alan Sillars'],37,False,Annals of the International Communication Association,[],1,89.89157435381,0.0009734664614494126,0.3333333333333333,0.10068142652301458
Religious attributions pertaining to the causes and cures of mental illness,2004,https://doi.org/10.1080/13674670412331304339,74,"In this Australian study, 126 Protestant Christian participants, 52 females and 74 males, were assessed for their beliefs about the importance of 26 causal variables and 25 treatment variables for two mental disorders: Major Depression and Schizophrenia. Factor analysis revealed four causal factors, common to both conditions, labelled as religious factors, physical factors, coping style and social/environmental stressors. Furthermore, four treatment factors emerged: religious means, professional help, help from others (non-professional) and self-initiated means. Explanatory variables for these beliefs were assessed using: a Religious Beliefs Inventory (RBI) to measure religious beliefs; a Values Survey (VS) including a measure of Christian religious values; and a Religion and Mental Health Inventory (RMHI) to measure cognitive dissonance (cf. Festinger, 1957 Festinger L 1957 A Theory of cognitive dissonance Evanston IL Row & Peterson [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) between religious faith and perceptions of mental-health principles. The results revealed that religious beliefs, religious values and cognitive dissonance function as predictors of the attribution of the causes and treatments, for Major Depression and Schizophrenia, to religious factors. An additional finding of this study was that 38.2% of the participants endorsed a demonic aetiology of Major Depression, and 37.4% of the participants endorsed a demonic aetiology of Schizophrenia.","['Cognitive dissonance', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Mental health', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Mental illness', 'Cognition', 'Faith', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Theology', 'Philosophy']","['Kristine Hartog', 'Kathryn Gow']",42,False,Mental Health Religion & Culture,[],1,89.89157435381,0.0009734664614494126,0.3333333333333333,0.10068142652301458
Attributions and Attitudes of Mothers and Fathers in China,2011,https://doi.org/10.1080/15295192.2011.585553,73,"SYNOPSIS Objective. The present study examined mothers' and fathers' attributions and attitudes related to parenting in China. Design. Interviews were conducted with 241 pairs of parents to obtain maternal and paternal reports of attributions regarding successes and failures in parent–child interactions and on progressive versus authoritarian attitudes about parenting. Results. Mothers' mean levels of attributions and attitudes did not differ significantly from fathers' mean levels of attributions and attitudes. The authors found significant correlations between mothers' and fathers' attributions regarding uncontrollable success, authoritarian attitudes, and modernity of attitudes. Conclusions. Supporting the cultural evolutionary view that drastic social changes bring about nonconforming and individualistic behavioral tendencies, these findings rectify and expand the existing literature portraying Chinese parenting as uniformly Confucian and traditional.","['Attribution', 'Authoritarianism', 'Psychology', 'China', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Individualism', 'Parenting styles', 'Political science', 'Politics', 'Law', 'Democracy']","['Lei Chang', 'Bin‐Bin Chen', 'Lin Ji']",49,False,Parenting,[],1,89.74857334676067,0.0009603115092676638,0.3333333333333333,0.10067221805648735
Association of Attributional Style for Negative and Positive Events and the Occurrence of Life Events with Depression and Anxiety,2006,https://doi.org/10.1521/jscp.2006.25.10.1140,73,"This study examined the relationship of attributional styles for negative and positive events with depression and anxiety. A sample of 239 college students underwent structured diagnostic interviews and completed self–report measures of attributional style and major life events at two time points separated by approximately four weeks. Using cross–sectional methodology, attributional styles for negative and positive events were compared across current diagnoses of unipolar depression and/or anxiety. A current mood disorder, when comorbid with an anxiety disorder, was associated with a tendency to see negative events as arising from internal, stable, and global causes. A depression diagnosis was distinguished from no depression diagnosis by the tendency to assign external, unstable, and specific causes for positive events. Using a prospective design, Time 1 attributional styles for negative and positive events were assessed as moderators of the relationships between negative and positive life events and levels of subsequent depression symptoms. The tendency to see negative events arising from internal, stable, and global causes and positive events arising from external, unstable, and specific causes, was associated with higher levels of clinician-assessed depression symptoms, particularly when confronted with negative life events or the absence of positive events. Findings indicate that attributional style for positive events contributes to our understanding of cognitive vulnerability to emotional disorders.","['Psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Attribution', 'Depression (economics)', 'Association (psychology)', 'Mood', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive vulnerability', 'Psychiatry', 'Developmental psychology', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['David M.

In total, 69 clinical and 69 control couples were recruited, and a series of multivariate analyses of variance and regression analyses were conducted to test both hypotheses.

CAUSES: Attribution of Surface Radiation Biases in NWP and Climate Models near the U.S. Southern Great Plains,2018,https://doi.org/10.1002/2017jd027188,71,"Abstract Many Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate models exhibit too warm lower tropospheres near the midlatitude continents. The warm bias has been shown to coincide with important surface radiation biases that likely play a critical role in the inception or the growth of the warm bias. This paper presents an attribution study on the net radiation biases in nine model simulations, performed in the framework of the CAUSES project (Clouds Above the United States and Errors at the Surface). Contributions from deficiencies in the surface properties, clouds, water vapor, and aerosols are quantified, using an array of radiation measurement stations near the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site. Furthermore, an in‐depth analysis is shown to attribute the radiation errors to specific cloud regimes. The net surface shortwave radiation is overestimated in all models throughout most of the simulation period. Cloud errors are shown to contribute most to this overestimation, although nonnegligible contributions from the surface albedo exist in most models. Missing deep cloud events and/or simulating deep clouds with too weak cloud radiative effects dominate in the cloud‐related radiation errors. Some models have compensating errors between excessive occurrence of deep cloud but largely underestimating their radiative effect, while other models miss deep cloud events altogether. Surprisingly, even the latter models tend to produce too much and too frequent afternoon surface precipitation. This suggests that rather than issues with the triggering of deep convection, cloud radiative deficiencies are related to too weak convective cloud detrainment and too large precipitation efficiencies.","['Shortwave radiation', 'Albedo (alchemy)', 'Climate model', 'Radiative transfer', 'Cloud albedo', 'Environmental science', 'Climatology', 'Atmospheric sciences', 'Shortwave', 'Cloud forcing', 'Precipitation', 'Cloud top', 'Middle latitudes', 'Cloud cover', 'Meteorology', 'Cloud computing', 'Radiation', 'Climate change', 'Geology', 'Geography', 'Physics', 'Art', 'Oceanography', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Performance art', 'Computer science', 'Art history', 'Operating system']","['Kwinten Van Weverberg', 'Cyril Morcrette', 'J.

OBA2: An Onion approach to Binary code Authorship Attribution,2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2014.03.012,70,"A critical aspect of malware forensics is authorship analysis. The successful outcome of such analysis is usually determined by the reverse engineer's skills and by the volume and complexity of the code under analysis. To assist reverse engineers in such a tedious and error-prone task, it is desirable to develop reliable and automated tools for supporting the practice of malware authorship attribution. In a recent work, machine learning was used to rank and select syntax-based features such as n-grams and flow graphs. The experimental results showed that the top ranked features were unique for each author, which was regarded as an evidence that those features capture the author's programming styles. In this paper, however, we show that the uniqueness of features does not necessarily correspond to authorship. Specifically, our analysis demonstrates that many ""unique"" features selected using this method are clearly unrelated to the authors' programming styles, for example, unique IDs or random but unique function names generated by the compiler; furthermore, the overall accuracy is generally unsatisfactory. Motivated by this discovery, we propose a layered Onion Approach for Binary Authorship Attribution called OBA2. The novelty of our approach lies in the three complementary layers: preprocessing, syntax-based attribution, and semantic-based attribution. Experiments show that our method produces results that not only are more accurate but have a meaningful connection to the authors' styles.","['Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Code (set theory)', 'Binary number', 'Attribution', 'Information retrieval', 'World Wide Web', 'Programming language', 'Natural language processing', 'Arithmetic', 'Mathematics', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Set (abstract data type)']","['Saed Alrabaee', 'Noman Saleem', 'Stere Preda', 'Lingyu Wang', 'Mourad Debbabi']",10,True,Digital Investigation,[],1,89.27962403491104,0.0009208466527224174,0.3333333333333333,0.10064459265690569

Self‐Serving Attributions in Corporate Annual Reports: A Replicated Study,2002,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-6486.00282,70,"This study is a replication of Bettman and Weitz (1983) in the Singapore context. Data from Letters to Shareholders in 208 annual reports published in 1985 and 1994 were used to analyse the patterns of causal explanations for corporate performance outcomes. The general self‐serving pattern of attributions found in the original study was also identified in this study. However, the data of the original study do not unequivocally support either the motivational or informational explanation for the existence of self‐serving attributions, whereas the latter explanation is strongly supported by the data of this study. This finding is consistent with the growing evidence provided by cross‐cultural psychological research indicating East Asians’ greater sensitivity to situational influences when making causal attributions. In short, the present study clearly illustrates the important role of replication in the knowledge accumulation and theory development of strategy research.","['Attribution', 'Situational ethics', 'Replication (statistics)', 'Psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Social psychology', 'Geography', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology']",['Eric W.

Finding fault: Causality and counterfactuals in group attributions,2012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2012.07.014,70,"Attributions of responsibility play a critical role in many group interactions. This paper explores the role of causal and counterfactual reasoning in blame attributions in groups. We develop a general framework that builds on the notion of pivotality: an agent is pivotal if she could have changed the group outcome by acting differently. In three experiments we test successive refinements of this notion - whether an agent is pivotal in close possible situations and the number of paths to achieve pivotality. In order to discriminate between potential models, we introduced group tasks with asymmetric structures. Some group members were complements (for the two to contribute to the group outcome it was necessary that both succeed) whereas others were substitutes (for the two to contribute to the group outcome it was sufficient that one succeeds). Across all three experiments we found that people's attributions were sensitive to the number of paths to pivotality. In particular, an agent incurred more blame for a team loss in the presence of a successful complementary peer than in the presence of a successful substitute.","['Counterfactual thinking', 'Attribution', 'Blame', 'Psychology', 'Outcome (game theory)', 'Counterfactual conditional', 'Causality (physics)', 'Social psychology', 'Group (periodic table)', 'Causal reasoning', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Cognition', 'Microeconomics', 'Economics', 'Chemistry', 'Physics', 'Organic chemistry', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience']","['Ro’i Zultan', 'Tobias Gerstenberg', 'David A.

The purpose of this paper is to present a model of the unique challenges that workers with ASD face in the modern workplace based on stigmas and discrimination surrounding mental health, attribution theory and the disconnect between behaviors common to neurodiverse individuals and some of the most researched theories in the field of organizational behavior. The goal of the paper is to encourage more empirical research focused specifically on ASD workers.

Blaming the Victim: The Effects of Extraversion and Information Disclosure on Guilt Attributions in Cyberbullying,2013,https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2012.0328,69,"Cyberbullying victims' success in coping with bullying largely depends on schoolmates and other bystanders' social support. However, factors influencing the degree of social support have as yet not been investigated. In this article, the concept of victim blaming is applied to cyberbullying incidents. It is assumed that a cyberbullying victim receives less social support when the victim's behavior is perceived as very overt. It is further assumed that this effect's underlying process is the partial attribution of responsibility for the incident to the victim and not to the bully. The hypotheses are tested with a 2×2 online experiment. In this experiment, varying online self-presentations of a fictitious female cyberbullying victim were presented to 586 Germans aged 16-22. The victim's public Facebook profile was manipulated in terms of the victim's extraversion and the amount of personal information disclosed. The results support the hypotheses. Participants attributed more responsibility for the bullying incident to the victim when the victim was presented as extraverted and very open in revealing personal information. This diminished social support for the victim. The effect was partially mediated by the victim's perceived attractiveness. The study implies that concepts from victimization research can enhance our understanding of cyberbullying incidents. Among other factors, the victim's specific personal characteristics deserve more consideration--not only with regard to the incident itself but also regarding subsequent social dynamics and coping mechanisms.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Extraversion and introversion', 'Attractiveness', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Personality', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychoanalysis']","['Mathias Weber', 'Marc Ziegele', 'Anna Schnauber']",45,False,Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking,[],1,89.11916750587446,0.0009076917005406685,0.3333333333333333,0.10063538419037846

We presented short sentences describing positive and negative social events and asked participants to imagine the event, to decide the main cause and assign it to one of the categories (internal vs. external). FMRI data were analyzed using a 2 × 2 factorial design with the factors emotional valence and attribution. Internal compared to external attribution revealed activations along the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ).

Given that the style of a text can be represented as mere word frequencies selected in a language-independent method, suitable machine learning techniques able to deal with high dimensional feature spaces and sparse data can be directly applied to solve this problem. This paper focuses on classifier ensembles based on feature set subspacing. It is shown that an effective ensemble can be constructed using, exhaustive disjoint subspacing, a simple method producing many poor but diverse base classifiers.

"Style, Statistics, and New Models of Authorship[1]",2009,,68,"I1. In this essay I argue that humanities computing can change ideas about the role authors play within texts and can offer a path to a new conception of authorship. My focus is on computational stylistics in particular. The results of this practice tell us on a statistical basis that texts reflect the styles of their authors to a remarkable, perhaps unsuspected, extent. The results do not support the idea that authors are insignificant as sources of meaning, but neither do they license a return to an older idea of sovereign, hegemonic authors, as I hope to show. The findings of computational stylistics can serve to test theories about authorship and in turn to suggest modifications to those theories.2. The link between theory and evidence has already been made by some commentators on authorship influenced by postmodernism. They make a wager: they believe that a certain theory about texts, which they hold to be valid, rules that attribution studies cannot work. They predict that empirical methods for attribution will necessarily be defeated by the variation within an authorial canon, and by competing commonalities between texts. Computational stylistics, taking up this challenge, can show that these predictions are false. This in turn suggests that the theory on which the predictions were made is inadequate. A new theory is needed which fits the new evidence.3. Putting it at its most grandiose we can say that with computational stylistics we can for the first time make a genuine connection between generalisation and detailed evidence about style. In the case of authorship, statistical studies might have revealed - were free to reveal - that authorship is insignificant in comparison to other factors like genre or period. In that case the theory that authors are only secondary to other forces in textual patterning would have been validated.

The Attribution of Mental Health Problems to Jinn: An Explorative Study in a Transcultural Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic,2018,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00089,68,"Background: Among Muslim patients, a common cultural concept of distress is the notion that jinn may be the cause of mental health problems, especially in the presence of hallucinations. Objective: The present study examines the frequency with which this attribution style is manifest in a specific psychiatric outpatient population with a Muslim background. Methods: Of all patients registered at an outpatient clinic specialized in transcultural psychiatry, data were collected on folk belief, religion, hallucinations (if present), and medical diagnosis. In addition, through a search in the electronic medical files, the notes made during the first contact and first psychiatric examination were screened for the keywords 'evil eye', 'magic', and 'voodoo', and 'jinn'. In addition, new eligible cases were accepted. Results: From all 551 patients thus screened,118 were eligible for participation. Of these, 49 (41.5%) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Among these 49 patients, 21 (43%) were positive that their psychiatric symptoms were caused by jinn, whereas 13 (27%) thought not, and 15 (31%) were in doubt. No less than 87.2% had experienced hallucinations during their lives. Among the relatively large proportion of eligible patients who did not participate (58.5%), many expressed a fear for stigmatization or metaphysical repercussions if they spoke about jinn. Conclusion: The phenomenon of attributing mental health symptoms to jinn was much more common in this population of Muslim patients than previously assumed. This underscores the need for proper knowledge of Muslim explanatory models of disease, and for the use of culturally sensitive interviewing techniques in this population.","['Psychiatry', 'Mental health', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Medicine', 'Mental healthcare', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology']","['A.

The results of this research revealed that the personality characteristic of emotional stability, but not extraversion, was related significantly to adolescent life satisfaction.

Children were matched on chronological age, verbal mental age and IQ. The children with autism were as able as the control groups at differentiating mechanical launches from intentional reactions. Moreover, their descriptions of the longer action sequence were significantly different neither in length nor in their use of mental state language from those of the controls. However, finer-grained analyses of the accounts showed that the children with autism involved themselves more in the narrative than did control children. They also made less reference to episodes showing actions between animate objects, especially when the objects were not in contact. The implications of these findings for theories of autistic social dysfunction are discussed.","['Autism', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Mental age', 'Theory of mind', 'Developmental disorder', 'Action (physics)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience']","['Dermot Bowler', 'Évelyne Thommen']",54,False,Autism,[],1,88.95434709634105,0.0008945367483589197,0.3333333333333333,0.10062617572385124

Attributional style and symptoms as predictors of social function in schizophrenia,2004,https://doi.org/10.1682/jrrd.2004.02.0225,68,"While the attributions of people with schizophrenia have been hypothesized to play a role in determining social behavior, contradictory predictions can be made about exactly what type of attributions contribute to social dysfunction. One possibility is that attributing undesirable events to internal, stable, and global factors might lead to poorer social function. An alternate possibility is that attributing events in general to internal, stable, and global factors might lead to better social function. As a test of these hypotheses, 40 participants in a post-acute phase of schizophrenia were administered the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Quality of Life Scale. Stepwise multiple regressions controlling for age and education indicated that a lack of negative symptoms and the tendency to make stable attributions for life events in general predicted more frequent social contacts, a higher quality of social interaction, and better community participation on the Quality of Life Scale. Results suggest that the tendency to see life events as the result of unstable or unpredictable causes is associated with social dysfunction independent of symptom level.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Quality of life (healthcare)', 'Scale (ratio)', 'Social relation', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social function', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social science', 'Physics', 'Archaeology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Sociology', 'History']","['Paul H.

Depressed and non‐depressed mothers with problematic preschoolers: Attributions for child behaviours,1998,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8260.1998.tb01396.x,68,"Objectives . This study examines the spontaneous causal attributions made by mothers about their preschool children's problem behaviour and investigates the relationship between causal attributions and maternal depression. Design . Two groups of mothers were compared, a depressed and a non‐depressed group, while all women included identified their preschool child as having some problem behaviours. There were 25 women in each group. Methods . The spontaneous attributions of mothers were assessed from audiotaped interviews using an adaptation of the Leeds Attributional Coding System for the extraction and analysis of attributional statements. Results . Depressed mothers made more spontaneous causal attributions about their children's problem behaviour than did the non‐depressed group; and the depressed group perceived these causes as being more stable, more controllable and more personal to the child than their non‐depressed counterparts. There was also evidence that depressed mothers made more internal attributions about themselves as the cause of their children's problem behaviour than non‐depressed mothers. The study indicates that the personal‐to‐child dimension is the attributional variable most strongly associated with depression. Conclusions . This study provides evidence that depressed mothers have attributional biases when compared to non‐depressed mothers. The authors suggest that their attributions may mediate coping responses and hence may influence parenting behaviour. The clinical and research implications of the findings are discussed.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Attribution bias', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Caroline White', 'Christine Barrowclough']",0,False,British Journal of Clinical Psychology,[],1,88.95434709634105,0.0008945367483589197,0.3333333333333333,0.10062617572385124

This paper considers the role of perceptual attribution in determining or guiding perceptual reference to objects. We consider three extant models of the relation between perceptual attribution and perceptual reference–all attribution guides reference, no attribution guides reference, or a privileged subset of attributions guides reference–and argue that empirical evidence undermines all three. We then defend a flexible‐attributives model , on which the range of perceptual attributives used to guide reference shifts adaptively with context. This model underscores the remarkable and dynamic intelligence of our perceptual capacities.

Developmental precursors of young school-age children’s hostile attribution bias.,2013,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0032293,68,"This prospective longitudinal study provides evidence of preschool-age precursors of hostile attribution bias in young school-age children, a topic that has received little empirical attention. We examined multiple risk domains, including laboratory and observational assessments of children's social-cognition, general cognitive functioning, effortful control, and peer aggression. Preschoolers (N = 231) with a more advanced theory-of-mind, better emotion understanding, and higher IQ made fewer hostile attributions of intent in the early school years. Further exploration of these significant predictors revealed that only certain components of these capacities (i.e., nonstereotypical emotion understanding, false-belief explanation, and verbal IQ) were robust predictors of a hostile attribution bias in young school-age children and were especially strong predictors among children with more advanced effortful control. These relations were prospective in nature-the effects of preschool variables persisted after accounting for similar variables at school age. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research and prevention.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Aggression', 'Attribution bias', 'Cognition', 'Theory of mind', 'Social cognition', 'Social information processing', 'Cognitive development', 'Longitudinal study', 'Social psychology', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Neuroscience']","['Daniel Ewon Choe', 'Jonathan D.

In a replication and extension of a study by Metalsky, Abramson, Seligman, Semmel, and Peterson (1982), we evaluated students' attributional style and their attributions for an examination performance in the college classroom. Additionally, an indirect probe was used to assess unsolicited attributions. Subjects were asked about their plans to prepare for the next examination in order to test for the motivational deficits predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness (RLH) model. Unlike Metalsky et al., attributional style did not predict depressed mood following a disappointing examination performance. Attributions for the particular examination performance were predictive of depressed mood for students who were disappointed in their examination performance. Few subjects, 31%, gave attributions in response to the indirect probe, and there was no support for the prediction that unexpected negative events would lead to subjects' making more attributions. Internal, stable, and global attributions for poor examination performance resulted in students making more plans to study for the next examination, a finding contrary to what is predicted by the RLH model.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Learned helplessness', 'Mood', 'Social psychology', 'Negative mood', 'Test (biology)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Biology']","['Victoria M.

Unique predictive contributions of all main effect and linear interactions of four attributional style dimensions (controllability, locus, stability, globality) to the prediction of two problems in living (depression, loneliness) were examined. Consistent with the proposed model, the globality dimension did not contribute uniquely. As expected, the controllability dimension was a particularly strong predictor of problems in living. Most important was the finding of several strong dimensional interactions, in which the effect of controllability attributional style on problems in living depended upon stability and locus attributional style. Additional analyses revealed that success and failure attributional style contribute interactively to the prediction of problems in living, and that loneliness is more uniquely associated with attributional style for interpersonal situations.

Impact of salient vocal qualities on causal attribution for a speaker's behavior.,1982,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.43.2.236,65,"Considerable research has demonstrated an illusory causation effect in which visually salient people are perceived as more causal of events in a social interaction than their nonsalient counterparts. The present studies extended this work to the realm of auditory salience. Two determinants of auditory salience were manipulated—the intensity of a speaker's voice and the sex of a speaker's voice. As predicted, subjects attended more to a 75-dB (A) than to a 70-dB voice on a binaural listening test, and subjects attributed more causality to an actor in a two-person conversation when his voice was 75 dB in intensity than when it was 70 dB. Contrary to expectation, subjects did not attend more to the voice whose sex matched their own on the binaural listening test. Rather, all subjects listened more to the actor with the male voice. Consistent with this tendency for the male voice to be more salient, subjects attributed more causality to an actor when the voice was-male than when it had been electronically converted to a female voice of the same intensity and intonation. Vocal salience also influenced subjects' impressions of the actors, but it had no impact on recall of the actors' verbalizations.

Ten hypothetical vignettes were used to assess attributions of intent. Both PCL-R and ISQ scores were significant predictors of hostile attributions. Further, the two processes appeared to relate differentially to the race of the participants, such that an ISQ-hostile attribution association was stronger among African American participants than among Caucasian participants.

Previously we have found that personal contribution and attribution were related to testosterone levels after successful competition. To confirm such associations, two basketball teams (n = 17 players) that emerged as winners in two actual matches were studied. Salivary testosterone levels and mood were measured before and after the games. Individual contribution to the outcome was assessed, and personal satisfaction and causal attribution of outcome were reported by players. Testosterone concentrations increased to near significance in Team 1 but not in Team 2, who attributed their victory more to luck than did Team 1. This latter team showed notably decreased vigor, and both teams showed fatigue at the end of the match. Post-match testosterone levels were only significantly, negatively related to external attribution. The results support the idea that causal attribution of the outcome is contributing to the variance of the testosterone responses to real confrontations where the outcome is highly dependent on personal merit.

Maternal child-centered attributions and harsh discipline: The moderating role of maternal working memory across socioeconomic contexts.,2014,https://doi.org/10.1037/fam0000023,64,"Cognitive models of parenting give emphasis to the central role that parental cognitions may play in parental socialization goals. In particular, dual process models suggest that parental attribution styles affect the way parents interpret caregiving situations and enact behaviors, particularly within the realm of discipline. Although research has documented the negative behavioral repercussions of dysfunctional child-centered responsibility biases, there is heterogeneity in the level of these associations. Research has also demonstrated that parental working memory capacity may serve as an individual difference factor in influencing caregiving behaviors. Thus, our first aim was to document how maternal working memory capacity may moderate the association between mother's dysfunctional child-oriented attributions and use of harsh discipline. In addition, from an ecological perspective, a second aim was to examine how socioeconomic risk may further potentiate the impact of maternal working memory. To accomplish these aims, a socioeconomically diverse sample of 185 mothers and their 3-year old children were recruited to participate in a laboratory-based research assessment. Findings revealed that lower maternal working memory capacity may operate as a risk factor for attributional biases and harsh discipline, and higher working memory may serve as a protective factor in this relationship. Socioeconomic risk further moderated these findings. Results suggest that the moderating role of working memory may be particularly pronounced under conditions of socioeconomic risk. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Psychology', 'Socioeconomic status', 'Dysfunctional family', 'Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Working memory', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Socialization', 'Cognition', 'Association (psychology)', 'Social psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Population', 'Sociology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Demography', 'Communication', 'Neuroscience']","['Melissa L.

It remains unclear whether this abnormality is present in individuals with non-persecutory delusions. Using the Attributional Style Questionnaire, we assessed the attributional style of 19 individuals with persecutory or grandiose delusions (PG), 12 individuals whose delusional beliefs were non-persecutory and non-grandiose (NPG) and 24 controls. The PG group displayed externality in their causal attributions for bad events but those in the NPG group did not differ from controls. Both deluded groups were significantly more stable in their attributions for bad events in comparison to controls.

The project runs multiple dynamical models of the atmosphere-land system under observed historical conditions as well as under naturalised versions of those observed conditions, with the latter representing how the climate system might have evolved in the absence of anthropogenic interference. Each model generates large ensembles of simulations with different initial conditions for each historical scenario, providing a large sample size for understanding interannual variability, long-term trends, and the anthropogenic role in rare types of weather.

Negative Affect Leads to Low-Effort Cognition: Attributional Processing for Observed Social Behavior,1989,https://doi.org/10.1521/soco.1989.7.4.315,63,"The proposed theory states that affect influences cognition by determining the amount of effort that is expended in information processing. It was predicted that negative affect leads to low-effort attributional processing and that positive affect leads to high-effort attributional processing. Correspondent dispositional attributions were considered low-effort attributions, and other attributions were considered high-effort attributions. In Studies 1 and 2, negative, neutral, and positive affect were induced by asking subjects to describe either negative, neutral, or positive events, respectively. Subjects then made attributions for others' positive and negative behaviors. In Studies 1 and 2, subjects in the negative affect condition generated more correspondent dispositional attributions than subjects in the positive or neutral affect conditions for both positive and negative behaviors.

Causal attributions for somatic sensations in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and their partners,2001,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291799003001,62,"Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) often make somatic attributions for their illness which has been associated with poor outcome. A tendency to make somatic attributions in general may be a vulnerability factor for the development of CFS.This cross-sectional study based on self-report questionnaire data aimed to investigate the type of attributions for symptoms made by patients with CFS and to compare this to attributions made by their partners. It was hypothesized that patients with CFS would make more somatic attributions for their own symptoms than control subjects and that partners of patients with CFS would make more somatic attributions for their ill relative's symptoms but would be similar to controls regarding their own symptoms. Fifty patients with CFS were compared to 50 controls from a fracture clinic in the same hospital and 46 relatives living with the patients with CFS. A modified Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire was used to assess causal attributions.CFS patients were more likely to make somatic attributions for their symptoms. The relatives of patients with CFS made significantly more somatic attributions for symptoms in their ill relative. However, they were like the fracture clinic controls in terms of making predominantly normalizing attributions for their own symptoms.The data support modification of existing cognitive behavioural treatments for CFS to investigate whether addressing partners' attributions for patients' symptoms improves recovery in the patient. Furthermore, a tendency to make somatic attributions for symptoms may be a vulnerability factor for the development of CFS.","['Attribution', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Cognition', 'Medicine', 'Chronic fatigue', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Communication', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics']","['John Butler', 'Trudie Chalder', 'Simon Wessely']",21,False,Psychological Medicine,[],1,87.86941926821082,0.0008156070352684268,0.3333333333333333,0.10057092492468789

Naïve Bayes classifiers for authorship attribution of Arabic texts,2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.06.006,62,"Authorship attribution is the process of assigning an author to an anonymous text based on writing characteristics. Several authorship attribution methods were developed for natural languages, such as English, Chinese and Dutch. However, the number of related works for Arabic is limited. Naïve Bayes classifiers have been widely used for various natural language processing tasks. However, there is generally no mention of the event model used, which can have a considerable impact on the performance of the classifier. To the best of our knowledge, naïve Bayes classifiers have not yet been considered for authorship attribution in Arabic. Therefore, we propose to study their use for this problem, taking into account different event models, namely, simple naïve Bayes (NB), multinomial naïve Bayes (MNB), multi-variant Bernoulli naïve Bayes (MBNB) and multi-variant Poisson naïve Bayes (MPNB). We evaluate these models' performances on a large Arabic dataset extracted from books of 10 different authors and compare them with other existing methods. The experimental results show that MBNB provides the best results and could attribute the author of a text with an accuracy of 97.43%. Comparison results with related methods indicate that MBNB and MNB are appropriate for authorship attribution.","['Authorship attribution', ""Bayes' theorem"", 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Naive Bayes classifier', 'Attribution', 'Arabic', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Machine learning', 'Bayesian probability', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Support vector machine', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology']","['Alaa Altheneyan', 'Mohamed El Bachir Menaï']",73,True,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,[],1,87.86941926821082,0.0008156070352684268,0.3333333333333333,0.10057092492468789

From behaviours to attributions: further concerns regarding the evaluation of professionalism,2009,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03335.x,62,"This study aimed to explore faculty attendings' scoring and opinions of students' written responses to professionally challenging situations.In this mixed-methods study, 10 pairs of faculty attendings (attending physicians in internal medicine) marked responses to a professionalism written examination taken by 40 medical students and were then interviewed regarding their scoring decisions. Quantitatively, inter-rater scoring agreement was calculated for each pair and students' global scores were compared with a previously developed theoretical framework. Qualitatively, interviews were analysed using grounded theory.Inter-rater reliability in scoring was poor. There was also no correlation between faculty's scores and our previous theoretical framework; this lack of correlation persisted despite modifications to the framework. Qualitative analysis of faculty attendings' interviews yielded three major themes: faculty preferred responses in which students expressed insight, showed responsibility, and ultimately put the patient first. Faculty also expressed difficulty in deciding what was more important (the behaviour or the rationale behind it) and in assigning numerical scores to students' responses. Interestingly, they did not downgrade students for mentioning implications for themselves as long as these were balanced by other considerations.This study attempted to overcome some of the instability that results when we judge behaviours by making the rationales behind students' behaviours explicit. However, between-faculty agreement was still poor. This reinforces concerns that professionalism, as a subtle and complex construct, does not reduce easily to numerical scales. Instead of concentrating on creating the 'perfect' evaluation instrument, educators should perhaps begin to explore alternative approaches, including those that do not rely on numerical scales.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Construct (python library)', 'Medical education', 'Qualitative research', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Computer science', 'Social science', 'Power (physics)', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Sociology', 'Programming language']","['Shiphra Ginsburg', 'Glenn Regehr', 'Maria Mylopoulos']",21,False,Medical Education,[],1,87.86941926821082,0.0008156070352684268,0.3333333333333333,0.10057092492468789

Methods: 70 fibromyalgia (FM) patients, 56 chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients and 72 healthy controls were assessed within a general hospital setting, using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory and Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire. Three-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests were used for inter-group comparisons, followed by multivariate correlation, covariate analysis and linear regression. Results: Alexithymia, somatization, depression, anxiety and hostility scores were significantly higher in FM patients relative to CLBP patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05). Alexithymia was linked to psychological attributions in FM patients and to somatic attributions in CLBP patients. Psychological attributions, the number of symptoms and difficulty in describing emotions were related to increased anxiety in FM patients. Depression, anxiety and somatization were significantly increased in subjects with high alexithymia scores in the FM group. There was no difference between groups regarding causal attributions.

"Iconisation, attribution and branding in orthography",2015,https://doi.org/10.1075/wll.18.2.02seb,62,"This paper discusses three processes relating to the social meaning of scripts and orthographies, all of which are potentially mediated by the role of script-as-image. One of these processes, iconisation , was introduced to the field by Irvine and Gal (2000) and is widely known. Attribution is a process which precedes iconisation, whereby a group of people associate a linguistic feature or language-related practice with a group of people who (supposedly) use that feature or engage in that practice. Orthographic branding involves a specific visual/graphical element of written language such as an alphabetic character. Through ‘branding,’ this element becomes an emblem of a group of people who use the element in question in their writing practices. Branding may involve iconisation, but the processes are distinct. This paper describes and distinguishes the three processes and provides examples from different languages and user communities.","['Element (criminal law)', 'Linguistics', 'Scripting language', 'Orthography', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Emblem', 'Attribution', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Character (mathematics)', 'Computer science', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Political science', 'Reading (process)', 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Pure mathematics', 'Law', 'Psychotherapist', 'Operating system', 'Geometry']",['Mark Sebba'],29,False,Written Language & Literacy,[],1,87.86941926821082,0.0008156070352684268,0.3333333333333333,0.10057092492468789

This study examined the impact of attributions of blame and responsibility for the cause and course of disease in 103 persons with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS‐related complex (ARC). Attributing the cause of disease to the self was significantly positively correlated with dysphoria (a combined measure of depression, anxiety, and negative mood) in persons with ADS, whereas possible improvement attributed to the self was significantly negatively correlated with dysphoria in the ARC group. Persons with AIDS who attributed more responsibility for improvement to themselves also made more health behavior changes. Conversely, in the ARC group, health behavior change was not associated with attributing possible improvement to the self. We found no relationship between self‐blame and any of the distress or behavior measures. Our findings that the pattern of association between attribution of responsibility are different between persons with AIDS and ARC underscores the need to examine psychological processes within the context of particular health conditions.

TOAST 1.0: Tropospheric Ozone Attribution of Sources with Tagging for CESM 1.2.2,2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2825-2018,61,"Abstract. A system for source attribution of tropospheric ozone produced from both NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors is described, along with its implementation in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2.2 using CAM4. The user can specify an arbitrary number of tag identities for each NOx or VOC species in the model, and the tagging system rewrites the model chemical mechanism and source code to incorporate tagged tracers and reactions representing these tagged species, as well as ozone produced in the stratosphere. If the user supplies emission files for the corresponding tagged tracers, the model will produce tagged ozone tracers which represent the contribution of each of the tag identities to the modelled total tropospheric ozone. Our tagged tracers preserve Ox. The size of the tagged chemical mechanism scales linearly with the number of specified tag identities. Separate simulations are required for NOx and VOC tagging, which avoids the sharing of tag identities between NOx and VOC species. Results are presented and evaluated for both NOx and VOC source attribution. We show that northern hemispheric surface ozone is dominated year-round by anthropogenic emissions of NOx, but that the mix of corresponding VOC precursors changes over the course of the year; anthropogenic VOC emissions contribute significantly to surface ozone in winter–spring, while biogenic VOCs are more important in summer. The system described here can provide important diagnostic information about modelled ozone production, and could be used to construct source–receptor relationships for tropospheric ozone.","['NOx', 'Tropospheric ozone', 'Ozone', 'Troposphere', 'Stratosphere', 'Atmospheric sciences', 'Environmental science', 'Meteorology', 'Chemistry', 'Geography', 'Geology', 'Combustion', 'Organic chemistry']","['Tim Butler', 'Aurelia Lupaşcu', 'J.

Overcoming skepticism toward cause-related marketing claims: the role of consumers’ attributions and a temporary state of skepticism,2018,https://doi.org/10.1108/jcm-06-2016-1827,59,"Purpose This paper aims to clarify a situational factor that might interfere with the intended outcome of a cause-related marketing (CRM) ad on social network sites (SNSs): statements about the motivation of the sponsoring company for supporting a social cause. This study also aims to explore how highly skeptical consumers and consumers with lower levels of skepticism differ in their responses to CRM ads. Design/methodology/approach In Study 1, a total of 409 college students took part in an online experiment through Qualtrics. The online experiment followed a 2 (statement of motivations: both of firm and public benefits vs public benefit only) × 2 (skepticism: high vs low) between-subjects design. Skepticism was determined post hoc as a two-category variable to analyze its effect on the relationship between the statement of motivations and attribution. In Study 2, a total of 533 adults took part in an online experiment. Multigroup analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings This study found that firm’s acknowledgments of firm-serving motivation, as well as of public-serving motivation, could be an effective marketing strategy to reduce consumer skepticism about the firm’s motives. The procedure by which a consumer perceived and evaluated the motives of a company determined the effectiveness of the company’s CRM ads. Temporary state of skepticism induced by an attributional thinking process is found to play a significant role in diminishing perceived corporate credibility. Finally, a consumer’s perception of a company’s credibility has a great impact on their intention to join that company’s brand page.

For example, “sensation-seeking” is predictive of the initial propensity to take drugs; whereas “novelty-seeking” predicts compulsive drug-seeking behavior. In addition, the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues can predict the propensity to approach drug cues, and reinstatement or relapse, even after relatively brief periods of drug exposure. The question addressed here is the extent to which these three ‘vulnerability factors’ are related; that is, predictive of one another. Some relationships have been reported in small samples, but here a large sample of 1,598 outbred male and female heterogeneous stock rats were screened for Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior (to obtain an index of incentive salience attribution; ‘sign-tracking’), and subsequently tested for sensation-seeking and novelty-seeking. Despite the large N there were no significant correlations between these traits, in either males or females. There were, however, novel relationships between multiple measures of incentive salience attribution and, based on these findings, we generated a new metric that captures “incentive value”.

Its aim was to investigate the role of parental and child achievement attributions as parameters of the child's actual school achievement and to examine the existing differences between attributions made by children and their parents. A total of 477 Sixth Grade Greek Cypriot students and their parents participated in the study. A structural equation model was constructed and its ability to fit the data was tested. It was found that child attributions of achievement to effort, ability and other internal factors are positively related to actual achievement, while attributions to luck and external factors are negatively related to achievement. This is in line with earlier findings. Parental and child attributions are not strongly and reliably related. Thus, claims that children develop their own attributions on the basis of their parents’ attributions were not supported. Gender differences were found, with females attributing their achievement to effort more than males did. Finally, underachievers tended to attribute their school performance to external factors (luck, role of others such as parents and teachers), while highly achieving students tended to attribute their performance to their own effort and other internal factors.","['Attribution', 'Luck', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Academic achievement', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Theology']",['Στέλιος Ν.

To explore the impact of facial prominence on impression formation, male and female subjects received either full‐body or portrait‐style photographs, made from the same negatives, of male and female stimulus persons of different likeability. Male and female subjects evaluated all stimulus persons as more competent (intelligent, assertive, ambitious, etc.) if presented with a high (portrait) rather than a low (full‐body photograph) degree of facial prominence. This main effect of facial prominence was not qualified by interaction effects with any of the other variables. PIUS, the media's face‐ism bias is likely to contribute to a perception of men as more competent than women. In addition, female but not male subjects also evaluated stimulus persons as more expressive and likeable under conditions of high facial prominence, reflecting a global positive effect of facial prominence.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Trait', 'Perception', 'Social psychology', 'Face perception', 'Impression formation', 'Social perception', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['Norbert Schwarz', 'Eva Kurz']",4,False,European Journal of Social Psychology,[],1,87.08459214501511,0.0007629872265414316,0.3333333333333333,0.100534091058579

Backpage and Bitcoin,2017,https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098082,58,"Sites for online classified ads selling sex are widely used by human traffickers to support their pernicious business. The sheer quantity of ads makes manual exploration and analysis unscalable. In addition, discerning whether an ad is advertising a trafficked victim or an independent sex worker is a very difficult task. Very little concrete ground truth (i.e., ads definitively known to be posted by a trafficker) exists in this space. In this work, we develop tools and techniques that can be used separately and in conjunction to group sex ads by their true owner (and not the claimed author in the ad). Specifically, we develop a machine learning classifier that uses stylometry to distinguish between ads posted by the same vs. different authors with 90% TPR and 1% FPR. We also design a linking technique that takes advantage of leakages from the Bitcoin mempool, blockchain and sex ad site, to link a subset of sex ads to Bitcoin public wallets and transactions. Finally, we demonstrate via a 4-week proof of concept using Backpage as the sex ad site, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to potentially find human traffickers.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Anonymity', 'Task (project management)', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Computer security', 'Space (punctuation)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Engineering', 'Systems engineering', 'Operating system']","['Rebecca S.

Simulating Conditions of Learned Helplessness: The Effects of Interventions and Attributions,1985,https://doi.org/10.2307/1129749,57,"We report 2 experiments that assess factors potentially responsible for a proactive interference with the sensitivity of a mother's response to infant signals. Using a version of the ""learned helplessness"" paradigm, mothers' performance on a solvable task was assessed following pretreatments that involved exposure to an infant cry but that differed in the mothers' ability to exert control over the termination of the cry. Each experiment explored the role of varying attributions made by a mother in the development of, or the reversal of, the helplessness phenomenon. The first experiment addressed the question of whether a specific intervention (i.e., providing the mother an attribution for failure) can reduce the debilitating effect of prior experience with failure. The results indicated that the debilitating effects associated with previous failure were reversed for the 16 mothers assigned to the intervention group. 40 mothers participated in the second experiment, which varied attributions assigned to an identical cry stimulus (i.e., the cry was produced by an ""easy"" vs. a ""difficult"" infant). This experiment assessed the effect of varying attributions on the mothers' ability to terminate the cry. We found that mothers pretreated with inescapable cries and those receiving the experimental manipulation of attributing the cry to a ""difficult"" infant showed debilitated performance in stopping the cry when given the opportunity. We propose that models based on learned helplessness theory have value in the study of caregiver-infant relationships, in particular, caregivers' perceived and objective effectiveness in responding to an infant's signals.","['Learned helplessness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychological intervention', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Wilberta L.

Illness attributions and hopelessness depression: The role of hopelessness expectancy.,1992,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-843x.101.2.257,56,"According to hopelessness theory, hopelessness expectancy is the proximal, sufficient cause of hopelessness depression.

Using a longitudinal research design, we examined hopelessness expectancy as a mediator of the relation between illness attributions and hopelessness depression in a sample of 57 adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Although hopelessness expectancy was a strong predictor of hopelessness depression, it moderated rather than mediated the relation between attributions and depression. Finding support for a moderating rather than a mediating model is inconsistent with theory but is consistent with the findings of Riskind, Rholes, Brannon, and Burdick (1987).","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Expectancy theory', 'Depression (economics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social psychology', 'Macroeconomics', 'Economics']","['Brenda M.

This bias indicated that persons with a dispositional orientation predicted more negative and less positive behavior from the target than persons with a situational orientation. The authors produced these findings in Studies I and 2 by manipulating the perceived characteristic motives of a target (dispositional, situational). In Study 3 the authors used a cultural operationalization of attributional orientations by examining the responses of Western students (dispositionalists) and East Asian students (situationalists). Finally, in support of the underlying mechanism, Study 4 showed that activating dispositional or situational knowledge facilitated the encoding of negative and positive behaviors, respectively.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Attribution bias', 'Social psychology']","['Oscar Ybarra', 'Walter G.

Non-parametric tests measured between-group differences and correlations between the key variables. There were few differences between the two professional groups for the key variables.

Results indicate that currently paranoid patients were significantly more likely than all other groups, including the remitted paranoid group, to use external-personal attributions in negative events.

These students completed the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS; Reynolds, 1987), the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ; Peterson et al., 1982), the Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire (CASQ; Seligman et al., 1984), the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS; Weissman, 1979), and rated themselves and were rated by their teachers regarding social competency. Multivariate analysis showed significant differences among the groups on these measures. Students with LD reported higher depressive symptomatology, displayed a more ""depressogenic"" attributional style, a more dysfunctional attitude, and rated themselves and were rated by their teachers as less socially competent than NSPED students. When the subgroups of LD and NSPED students were compared, the LD-US group differed significantly from the two NSPED groups more frequently than did the LD-S group. Additional multivariate analysis revealed that students who reported the most depressive symptoms differed from students who reported the least depressive symptoms on all measures. Results suggest that adolescent subgroups differ in self-reported depressive symptomatology, and support attributional, cognitive, and social learning competency theories of depression for adolescents.

Comparing techniques for authorship attribution of source code,2012,https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2146,55,"Attributing authorship of documents with unknown creators has been studied extensively for natural language text such as essays and literature, but less so for non-natural languages such as computer source code. Previous attempts at attributing authorship of source code can be categorised by two attributes: the software features used for the classification, either strings of n tokens/bytes (n-grams) or software metrics; and the classification technique that exploits those features, either information retrieval ranking or machine learning. The results of existing studies, however, are not directly comparable as all use different test beds and evaluation methodologies, making it difficult to assess which approach is superior. This paper summarises all previous techniques to source code authorship attribution, implements feature sets that are motivated by the literature, and applies information retrieval ranking methods or machine classifiers for each approach. Importantly, all approaches are tested on identical collections from varying programming languages and author types. Our conclusions are as follows: (i) ranking and machine classifier approaches are around 90% and 85% accurate, respectively, for a one-in-10 classification problem; (ii) the byte-level n-gram approach is best used with different parameters to those previously published; (iii) neural networks and support vector machines were found to be the most accurate machine classifiers of the eight evaluated; (iv) use of n-gram features in combination with machine classifiers shows promise, but there are scalability problems that still must be overcome; and (v) approaches based on information retrieval techniques are currently more accurate than approaches based on machine learning.

POLITICAL IDENTITY AND SUPPORT FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: A TEST OF ATTRIBUTION THEORY,2006,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648x.2006.9721217,55,"ABSTRACT Studies of public support for capital punishment have consistently observed modest relationships between both political ideology and party affiliation and support for the death penalty; conservatives and Republicans are more inclined to support capital punishment than are liberals and Democrats. This relationship has endured over time and space as well as across a myriad of research designs. Despite its constancy, this relationship has remained unexplained. This study employs the theoretical rubrics of political socialization and identity formation and attribution theory to account for this relationship. Analyses of survey data obtained from jurors summoned to service provide clear support for our claims. That is, conservatives and Republicans are more inclined to support capital punishment because they are also more inclined to adopt a dispositional attribution style which stresses the individual responsibility, deservedness, and moral culpability of criminal offender","['Attribution', 'Culpability', 'Social psychology', 'Ideology', 'Capital punishment', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'Punishment (psychology)', 'Identity (music)', 'Criminology', 'Social identity theory', 'Spanking', 'Socialization', 'Positive economics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Poison control', 'Social group', 'Human factors and ergonomics', 'Medicine', 'Physics', 'Environmental health', 'Acoustics']","['John K.

How People Think about Causes: Examination of the Typical Phenomenal Organization of Attributions for Success and Failure,1991,https://doi.org/10.1521/soco.1991.9.4.295,55,"Much is known about attribution processes and attributional effects, yet little is known about how people actually think about causes. This question has usually been addressed in the form, “Which causal dimensions do people use?” rather than “How do people think about causes?.” A review of the literature revealed three main confusions. First, scientific description of attributional effects on outcome variables is confused with phenomenal description of how people think about causes. Second, whether or not people can think about a particular dimension is confused with whether or not people do think in terms of that dimension. Third, whether or not people can think of causes in dimensional terms is confused with whether people typically think of causes in a dimensional versus categorical fashion. Necessary criteria for examination of the phenomenal description question were discussed. New data meeting those criteria were presented. The main findings were: (1) Strong evidence that people typically think in categorical terms; (2) Weak evidence that people may also typically think of a few standard attribution dimensions; (3) Strong evidence that a major concern of people when thinking about causes is personal control; (4) Strong evidence that several standard attribution dimensions are not represented in people's typical thoughts about causes, specifically, stability, globality, and control-by-someone. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Globality', 'Social psychology', 'Dimension (graph theory)', 'Categorical variable', 'Causality (physics)', 'Control (management)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Market economy', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Management', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science', 'Pure mathematics', 'Economics', 'Globalization']",['Craig A.

Attribution Theory Applied to Helping Behaviour Towards People with Intellectual Disabilities Who Challenge,2007,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-3148.2007.00390.x,55,"Introduction Attribution theory posits that helping behaviour is determined in part by the potential helper’s attributions and emotions regarding the behaviour that requires help. Specifically, helping is considered to be more likely if stability is perceived as low, generating optimism for change, and if controllability is perceived as low, engendering high levels of sympathy and low levels of anger. Method We conducted a systematic literature search to identify studies that have tested these predictions in relation to carers’ propensity to help people with intellectual disabilities who display challenging behaviour. Results The literature is inconsistent and provides at best partial support for the theory. This situation differs from that seen in the general population, where the predictions of attribution theory are broadly supported. Discussion We consider three potential explanations for this discrepancy: the reliability of the largely vignette‐based methodology, the fact that most studies fail to define ‘helping’ explicitly and the possibility that attribution theory might apply only to low‐frequency behaviours.","['Attribution', 'Vignette', 'Psychology', 'Sympathy', 'Social psychology', 'Anger', 'Challenging behaviour', 'Optimism', 'Population', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Learning disability', 'Demography', 'Sociology']","['Paul Willner', 'Mark Smith']",47,True,Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities,[],1,86.41322591473649,0.000723522369996185,0.3333333333333333,0.10050646565899732

Attributional Consequences of Powerful and Powerless Speech Styles in a Crisis-Intervention Context,1984,https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927x8431001,55,"This study examined effects of power of speech style and stylistic reciprocity in a particular interpersonal context. Speakers were an actor and an actress both of whom portrayed a 'client' and a 'counsellor' in a hypothetical 'crisis intervention' episode. The primary concern was with observers' evaluations of the relatively powerful counsellor and powerless client when they matched or mismatched powerful or powerless styles. Respondents were 135 undergraduates who listened to audiotapes of the counsellor-client interchange and subsequently evaluated both persons on a number of dimensions. The basic design was: power of style (high-low) X reciprocity of style (similar-dissimilar styles) X role (counsellor-client). Data were subjected to factor analyses and multivariate analyses of variance. Among others, results indicated that the high-power style produced higher ratings of Socio-Intellectual Status and Attractiveness, especially when this style was non-reciprocal. For female respondents ratings of Dynamism and Internality showed a similar pattern. The results suggest that speech accommodation processes are diminished in evaluative importance in the case of high-and low power speech styles.","['Psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social psychology', 'Attractiveness', 'Accommodation', 'Multivariate analysis of variance', 'Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Archaeology', 'Machine learning', 'Psychiatry', 'Biology', 'Computer science', 'Psychoanalysis', 'History', 'Neuroscience']","['James J.

EmailProfiler: Spearphishing Filtering with Header and Stylometric Features of Emails,2016,https://doi.org/10.1109/compsac.2016.105,55,"Spearphishing is a prominent targeted attack vector in today's Internet. By impersonating trusted email senders through carefully crafted messages and spoofed metadata, adversaries can trick victims into launching attachments containing malicious code or into clicking on malicious links that grant attackers a foothold into otherwise well-protected networks. Spearphishing is effective because it is fundamentally difficult for users to distinguish legitimate emails from spearphishing emails without additional defensive mechanisms. However, such mechanisms, such as cryptographic signatures, have found limited use in practice due to their perceived difficulty of use for normal users. In this paper, we present a novel automated approach to defending users against spearphishing attacks. The approach first builds probabilistic models of both email metadata and stylometric features of email content. Then, subsequent emails are compared to these models to detect characteristic indicators of spearphishing attacks. Several instantiations of this approach are possible, including performing model learning and evaluation solely on the receiving side, or senders publishing models that can be checked remotely by the receiver. Our evaluation of a real data set drawn from 20 email users demonstrates that the approach effectively discriminates spearphishing attacks from legitimate email while providing significant ease-of-use benefits over traditional defenses.","['Computer science', 'Metadata', 'Phishing', 'Computer security', 'World Wide Web', 'The Internet', 'Header', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Probabilistic logic', 'Bloom filter', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer network', 'Programming language']","['Sevtap Duman', 'Kubra Kalkan-Cakmakci', 'Manuel Egele', 'William Robertson', 'Engin Kirda']",27,False,,[],1,86.41322591473649,0.000723522369996185,0.3333333333333333,0.10050646565899732

Attributions and Appraisals of Workplace Incivility: Finding Light on the Dark Side?,2018,https://doi.org/10.1111/apps.12127,54,"Ample research demonstrates that workplace incivility has individual and organisational costs, but an important question remains unanswered: might it have benefits as well? We investigate this possibility by focusing on incivility appraisals—both negative and challenge appraisals (i.e. as an opportunity for learning, growth)—and their correlates. To explain this diversity of appraisals, we examine whether attributions (i.e. perceived intent to harm, perceived perpetrator control) predict perceptions. We conducted two multi‐method (quantitative and qualitative) surveys, one of which was multi‐source, of employees across a range of occupations. In Study 1, attributions that perpetrators acted with control and malicious intent fuelled negative appraisals of incivility, which undermined job satisfaction. Study 2 added to these findings by demonstrating that some targets formed challenge appraisals of uncivil encounters, especially when they attributed low malicious intent to perpetrators; challenge appraisal related to boosts in job satisfaction and thriving. These attitudinal outcomes then positively related to organisational citizenship behaviour, as reported by targets' coworkers. Showing paths to incivility harm (and potential benefit), our findings can inform interventions to alter the impact of workplace incivility.","['Incivility', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Harm', 'Thriving', 'Psychological intervention', 'Perception', 'Workplace bullying', 'Job satisfaction', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapist']","['Lisa A.

"Locus of Control, Attributional style, and Academic Achievement: Comparative Analysis of Korean‐Chinese, and Chinese Students",1998,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-839x.00013,54,"The authors conducted two studies to examine the relationship between attributional style, locus of control, and academic achievement. Using the scales developed by the first author (Park, 1995), the first study compared the attributional style and locus of control of honor students (those who received scholarship) with those who were on academic probation. The results indicated that compared to students on academic probation, honor students were more likely to score higher on internal locus of control and lower on external locus of control. They were more likely to attribute their success to effort and the influence of other people. For failure, the honor students were less likely to attribute their failure to a lack of ability and lack of support from significant others. The second study examined the relationship between the locus of control and academic achievement among three samples: Korean, Korean‐Chinese, and Chinese university students. A 40‐item locus of control questionnaire and background information section containing sex and self‐reported academic grade were administered. The results showed that the Korean sample had the highest internal locus of control score and the lowest external locus of control score. The Korean‐Chinese sample, in contrast, scored highest on external locus of control. These results are consistent with past research investigating the cultural influence upon the individual’s locus of control. Furthermore, as found in the first study, a significant relationship was found between locus of control and academic grade. For the Korean sample, students with higher academic grades scored higher on internality and lower on externality. For the Chinese sample, students with higher academic grades scored higher on internality. There were no significant differences for the Korean‐Chinese sample.

Attributional Style, Depressed Mood, and Persecutory Delusions in Patients With Schizophrenia",2014,https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbu040,54,"Theoretical models postulate an important role of attributional style (AS) in the formation and maintenance of persecutory delusions and other positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, current research has gathered conflicting findings. In a cross-sectional design, patients with persistent positive symptoms of schizophrenia (n = 258) and healthy controls (n = 51) completed a revised version of the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ-R) and assessments of psychopathology. In comparison to controls, neither patients with schizophrenia in general nor patients with persecutory delusions (n = 142) in particular presented an externalizing and personalizing AS. Rather, both groups showed a ""self-blaming"" AS and attributed negative events more toward themselves. Persecutory delusions were independently predicted by a personalizing bias for negative events (beta = 0.197, P = .001) and by depression (beta = 0.152, P = .013), but only 5% of the variance in persecutory delusions could be explained. Cluster analysis of IPSAQ-R scores identified a ""personalizing"" (n = 70) and a ""self-blaming"" subgroup (n = 188), with the former showing slightly more pronounced persecutory delusions (P = .021). Results indicate that patients with schizophrenia and patients with persecutory delusions both mostly blamed themselves for negative events. Nevertheless, still a subgroup of patients could be identified who presented a more pronounced personalizing bias and more severe persecutory delusions. Thus, AS in patients with schizophrenia might be less stable but more determined by individual and situational characteristics that need further elucidation.","['Psychology', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Psychopathology', 'Attribution', 'Mood', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Association (psychology)', 'Paranoia', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social psychology']","['Stephanie Mehl', 'Manfred Landsberg', 'Anna-Christine Schmidt', 'Maurice Cabanis', 'Andreas Bechdolf', 'Jutta Herrlich', 'Stephanie Loos-Jankowiak', 'Tilo Kircher', 'S.

Children's attributions in the family: The Children's Relationship Attribution Measure.,1998,https://doi.org/10.1037/0893-3200.12.4.481,54,"This study assessed children's attributions in parent-child relationships, examined their association with relationship positivity and behavior displayed toward the parent, determined whether depressive symptoms account for these associations, and investigated whether parent and child attributions are linked. Ten- to 12-yearold children (116 girls, 116 boys) completed several questionnaires and were observed during parent-child interactions. Children's attributions for parent behavior were related to positivity of the parent-child relationship and to self- and parent-reported conflict and observed behavior with the father. These associations were not due to children's depressive symptoms but potentially augment our understanding of the effect of depression on parent-child relationships. Finally, gender moderated the parent attribution-child attribution association. The results underscore the importance of children's perceptions of family processes. The study of children's perceptions of family events has led to increased understanding of their reactions to such events at both theoretical (e.g., Davies & Cummings, 1994; Grych & Fincham, 1990) and empirical levels (e.g., Grych, Seid, & Fincham, 1992; Kurdek & Berg, 1987; Mazur, Wolchik, & Sandier, 1992).

"Attributional style, defensive functioning and persecutory delusions: Symptom-specific or general coping strategy?",2006,https://doi.org/10.1348/014466505x50509,54,"Objective. Previous research has suggested that individuals with persecutory delusions use an exaggerated self‐serving bias to protect themselves from real or delusional threats to their underlying self‐concept. However, the research to date has been inconsistent thereby limiting the conclusion that can be inferred. A possible explanation for these discrepant findings may be due to the use of measures with questionable validity and reliability such as the Attributional Style Questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Inventory. The present study aims to re‐examine this theory using an improved methodology to determine whether defensive functioning is a defining feature of persecutory delusions. Design and methods. Thirty‐five participants suffering from recent onset psychosis were assessed in a cross‐sectional design. Three tests of attributional style were used, two overt measures (Attributional Style Questionnaire, ASQ; and the Internal Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire, IPSAQ) and one covert measure (Pragmatic Inference Test). Self‐esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Inventory (SEI) and a semi‐structured interview (Self‐Evaluation and Social Support interview – schizophrenia version). Results. A self‐serving bias (SSB) was found in the total sample using the ASQ but not specifically in participants with persecutory delusions. In addition, the SSB was unrelated to levels of paranoia on any measure of attributional style. An underlying depressive attributional style was found in both subjects with and without persecutory delusions, but was not associated with levels of paranoia. Lower positive and higher negative self‐esteem was associated with increased paranoia and was associated with a SSB. Conclusion.

Organizational Creativity as an Attributional Process: The Case of Haute Cuisine,2017,https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840617727779,54,"In this paper, we develop a framework that conceptualizes organizational creativity as an attributional process in which organizational creativity is constantly negotiated between an organization and its environment through ‘entre-relating activities’. Based on an empirical analysis of this process in the haute-cuisine restaurant Rutz in Berlin, we explore four entre-relating activities – surprising, satisfying, stimulating and savouring – through which ‘being creative’ and ‘being considered creative’ are set in relation to negotiate the attribution of organizational creativity. Our findings demonstrate how the sequential performance of these entre-relating activities is consequential for the gradual transition of external evaluations of an organization’s outcomes, from being considered ‘different’ to ‘one of a kind’, and thus the increasing attribution of organizational creativity over time. Our study contributes to the literature on organizational creativity by exploring the interplay between ‘being creative’ and ‘being considered creative’ through entre-relating activities, which is foundational for understanding organizational creativity. Furthermore, our findings put aesthetic responses at the centre of organizational creativity and demonstrate the playfulness of the process through which the attribution of organizational creativity is produced.","['Creativity', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Process (computing)', 'Creativity technique', 'Negotiation', 'Organization development', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Social psychology', 'Knowledge management', 'Sociology', 'Social science', 'Computer science', 'Programming language', 'Operating system']","['Jochen Koch', 'Matthias Wenzel', 'Ninja Natalie Senf', 'Corinna Maibier']",70,True,Organization Studies,[],1,86.18261161463579,0.0007103674178144362,0.3333333333333333,0.1004972571924701
Corpus linguistics and the study of literature,2011,https://doi.org/10.1075/ssol.1.1.02bib,53,"The present paper introduces corpus-based analytical techniques and surveys some of the specific ways in which corpus analysis has been applied to the study of literature. In recent years, those research efforts have been mostly carried out under the umbrella of ‘corpus stylistics’. Most of these studies focus on the distribution of words (analyzing keywords, extended lexical phrases, or collocations) to identify textual features that are especially characteristic of an author or particular text. Corpus-based grammatical and pragmatic analyses of literary language are also briefly considered. Then, in the concluding part of the paper, I briefly survey earlier computational and statistical research on authorship attribution and literary style. While that research tradition is in some ways the precursor to more recent work in corpus stylistics, it is also complementary to recent research in its application of sophisticated statistical and computational methods.","['Corpus linguistics', 'Stylistics', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Focus (optics)', 'Computational linguistics', 'Natural language processing', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Writing style', 'Stylometry', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Optics']",['Douglas Biber'],0,False,Scientific Study of Literature,[],1,85.95334004699563,0.0006972124656326875,0.3333333333333333,0.10048804872594287

Helplessness training consisted of experience with noncontingent failures on four cognitive discrimination problems attributed to either global or specific causes. Experiment 1 found that performance in a dissimilar situation was impaired following exposure to globally attributed failure. Experiment 2 examined the behavioral effects of the interaction between stable and global attributions of failure. Exposure to unsolvable problems resulted in reduced performance in a dissimilar situation only when failure was attributed to global and stable causes. Finally, Experiment 3 found that learned helplessness deficits were a product of the interaction of global and internal attribution. Performance deficits following unsolvable problems were recorded when failure was attributed to global and internal causes.

The writeprints used here involve stylometric features and content features derived from topic models, an unsupervised approach for identifying relevant keywords that relate to the content areas of a document. One innovation of our approach is to transform the writeprint feature values into a representation that individually balances characteristic and uncharacteristic traits of an author, and we subsequently apply a Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression classifier to this novel representation. Our method yields high accuracy for authorship deception detection on the two case studies, confirming its utility.","['Deception', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Authorship attribution', 'Multinomial logistic regression', 'Stylometry', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Machine learning', 'Representation (politics)', 'Natural language processing', 'Feature learning', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Law']","['Lisa Pearl', 'Mark Steyvers']",34,False,Literary and Linguistic Computing,[],1,85.95334004699563,0.0006972124656326875,0.3333333333333333,0.10048804872594287

Children's attributions for success and failure: Effects of age and attentional focus.,1988,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.80.1.76,52,"This study was an assessment of how children's achievement attributions were influenced by their age, attentional focus, gender, and success or failure experience. Older and younger elementary school children performed a memory task under either self-focusing or task-focusing instructions. After performance, half of the children in each condition were given success feedback and the other half failure feedback. Attributions for performance were then obtained. In the success condition, children judged effort to be the most important cause of their performance, whereas children in the failure condition attributed their performance mostly to the difficulty of the task and their inability to remember the story. Older children in the self-focus condition attributed success more to internal causes than did older children in the task-focus condition. Younger children attributed both success and failure more to luck than did older children. Few sex differences in attributions were obtained. Achievement attributions have significant consequences for subsequent achievement motivation and behavior; attributing success to one's ability and failure to lack of effort promotes positive achievement motivation and behavior, whereas attributing success to external factors such as task ease and failure to lack of ability has negative consequences (Weiner, 1979). Many researchers have assessed the development of children's attributions for achievement successes and failures (see Frieze, 1981, for a review). In general, these studies show that children under age 8 tend to confuse different causes such as ability and effort. By age 12 or 13, children's attributions seem quite similar to those of adults.

A trait × target ideology × perceiver ideology × trait valence interaction suggested that both liberals and conservatives more strongly associated their ingroup with stereotype-consistent positive traits, and their outgroup with stereotype-consistent negative traits. Mediation analyses revealed that outgroup antipathy, but not ingroup liking, explained the relationship between ideology and political outgroup dehumanization. Finally, humanness traits captured subtle differences in political stereotype content not captured with the warmth and competence dimensions derived from the stereotype content model.

Assessing parent attributions for child behavior using open-ended questions,1998,https://doi.org/10.1207/s15374424jccp2701_10,52,"Abstract Assessedparent attributions for child behavior using open-ended questions. Sixty-one parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 49 parents of nonproblem children participated. An open-ended, thought-listing question asked following child behavior indicated that parents spontaneously offer causal attributions for their children's behavior. Responses to a second open-ended question asking specifically for attributions for the child behavior indicated that both groups of parents attributed prosocial (PRO) child behaviors more than problem behaviors to internal, controllable, and stable causes or to the external situation and attributed problem behaviors most often to uncontrollable and unstable causes within the child or to factors within the parent. Compared with parents of nonproblem children, parents of children with ADHD were less likely to see themselves as the cause of child behavior and were more likely to mention medication. Analyses indicated that, although attributions elicited by ratings scales were related to attributions provided in an open-ended format, each method provided unique information.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Prosocial behavior', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Charlotte Johnston', 'Shawn Reynolds', 'Wendy Freeman', 'Josie Geller']",0,False,Journal of Clinical Child Psychology,[],1,85.71399798590132,0.0006840575134509386,0.3333333333333333,0.10047884025941566

Attributional biases in paranoid schizophrenia: Further evidence for a decreased sense of self‐causation in paranoia,2010,https://doi.org/10.1080/17522431003717675,52,"Attributional biases are assumed to be part of the pathogenesis of persecutory delusions. The aim of the present study was to explore whether such biases are confined to current paranoid delusions or related to other positive symptoms as well. Another goal was to investigate whether current paranoid schizophrenia patients only show an exaggerated personalizing bias for negative events (i.e. personalizing blame) or also tend to externalize responsibility for positive events (i.e. decreased sense of self‐causation). The Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ) was administered to 29 schizophrenia patients (10 with current paranoia), 26 psychiatric patients (OCD) and 33 healthy controls. Acutely paranoid patients made fewer internal attributions for positive and negative events, thus replicating a previously reported decreased sense of self‐causation. This kind of attributional style was related to acute positive symptomatology, but not to persecutory beliefs in particular. No evidence was found for a relationship between personalizing blame and the severity of current persecutory beliefs. An analysis of the narrative causal statements of the IPSAQ revealed that paranoid patients more often made external‐situational attributions particularly for positive events. Both psychiatric groups gave significantly more mono‐causal explanations for events than healthy controls.","['Paranoia', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Causation', 'Paranoid schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Situational ethics', 'Blame', 'Delusion', 'Paranoid Disorders', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychosis', 'Social psychology', 'Political science', 'Law']","['Sarah Randjbar', 'Ruth Veckenstedt', 'Francesca Vitzthum', 'Birgit Hottenrott', 'Steffen Moritz']",41,False,Psychosis,[],1,85.71399798590132,0.0006840575134509386,0.3333333333333333,0.10047884025941566

The role of attribution of motivation in producing postsuppressional rebound.,2001,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.377,52,Three studies demonstrated that postsuppressional rebound (PSR) may be both reduced and enhanced by manipulating people's attributions about why they experience difficulty during suppression. Telling participants that suppression failures indicate a high motivation to use the suppressed construct produced more PSR than telling them that suppression failures indicate a low motivation to use the construct (Study 1). Telling participants that an external stimulus would make suppression easy produced more PSR than telling them that it would make suppression difficult (Study 2). Telling participants that suppressing a stereotype is difficult and unindicative of prejudice eliminated PSR (Study 3). These results support the notion that PSR occurs because people infer from the difficulty experienced during suppression and from suppression failures that they are motivated to use the suppressed construct.,"['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Construct (python library)', 'Thought suppression', 'Social psychology', 'Prejudice (legal term)', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Stereotype (UML)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Neuroscience', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['Jens Förster', 'Nira Liberman']",84,False,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,[],1,85.71399798590132,0.0006840575134509386,0.3333333333333333,0.10047884025941566

Further, was there a differential impact of the intervention on hostile attributions in the context of peer provocation versus group entry scenarios?Participants consisted of 100 children (51% male) with PAE between the ages of 6 and 12 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either a social skills intervention, Children's Friendship Training (CFT), or to a Delayed Treatment Control (DTC) condition.Analyses indicated that the social skills intervention resulted in a significantly lower proportion of hostile attributions in peer group entry, but not peer provocation, scenarios.

Factors affecting the Human Attribution of Emotions toward Animals,2015,https://doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2015.1052270,52,"Attribution of emotions to animals can affect human–animal interactions and dictate animal welfare laws. However, little is known about the factors that influence these attributions. We investigated the effect of belief in animal mind, pet ownership, emotional intelligence, eating orientation, and gender on the attribution of different emotions to a variety of species, from different taxonomic classes, considered as Pet, Use (e.g., used for food, experimentation), or Pest animals. Three hundred and forty-seven participants, aged between 16 and 65 years, completed a questionnaire that measured their belief in the capacity for animals to experience seven primary and secondary emotions. The results showed that attribution of emotions to animals is inconsistent. The ambiguity appears to hinge, in part, upon an animal's functional category and their perceived place in the commonly supposed, though inaccurate, linear hierarchy of species. Nonetheless, the wide range of emotions that were attributed to all species highlights the complex and potentially disorganized thoughts that humans have concerning animals. Belief in animal mind was found to be the strongest and only predictor of emotion attribution to animals in general, but is probably because both are part of the same underlying construct. Ownership of some species—rabbits, horses, rodents and birds—mediated the emotions attributed to that particular species. We conclude that ambiguous attitudes influence the standards of welfare for animals used by humans and that the dichotomous attitudes permit exploitation and welfare violations against animals. Greater understanding of emotion attribution has the potential to improve humane education methods, and suggestions for future research are made.","['Attribution', 'Animal welfare', 'Psychology', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Social psychology', 'Ambiguity', 'Construct (python library)', 'Sentience', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Biology', 'Ecology', 'Environmental ethics', 'Communication', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['Abbie M.

Teachers were interviewed regarding their perceptions of the causes of students' problems, their control over the problem, their self-efficacy for resolving the problem on their own, and their choice of intervention: child referral, consultation, or handling the problem without assistance. Two series of discriminant function analyses (DFAs) were applied to determine how well intervention choice could be predicted by (a) ratings of the importance of six causal factors, or (b) teachers' perceptions of control over the problem and self-efficacy for resolving the problem. Seven of the 12 DFAs for the second function were significant, with self-efficacy consistently predicting teachers' choices to attempt to resolve the problem on their own rather than to seek assistance through consultation or referral. Generally, teachers' self-efficacy, perceptions of control, and attributions did not predict teachers' decisions to seek consultation or to refer the child. More experienced teachers selected referral more often than less experienced teachers.

Generally, essays which described successful episodes while working on a computer were more often written using impersonal references to the computer; essays describing failure episodes contained more personal, intimate terms for the computer. Females made tool-like references more often than males. However, the hypothesis that people would view the computer more as a tool with increased experience was confirmed only for females.

Mental State Attribution and Body Configuration in Women,2012,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnevo.2012.00001,51,"Body configuration is a sexually dimorphic trait. In humans, men tend to have high shoulder-to-hip ratios. Women in contrast, often have low waist-to-hip ratios (WHR); i.e., narrow waists and broad hips that approximate an hour-glass configuration. Women with low WHR's are rated as more attractive, healthier, and more fertile. They also tend to have more attractive voices, lose their virginity sooner, and have more sex partners. WHR has also been linked with general cognitive performance. In the present study we expand upon previous research examining the role of WHR in cognition. We hypothesized that more feminine body types, as indexed by a low WHR, would be associated with cognitive measures of the female ""brain type,"" such as mental state attribution and empathy because both may depend upon the activational effects of estrogens at puberty. We found that women with low WHRs excel at identifying emotional states of other people and show a cognitive style that favors empathizing over systemizing. We suggest this relationship may be a byproduct of greater gluteofemoral fat stores which are high in the essential fatty acids needed to support brain development and cellular functioning. It is interesting to note that our findings suggest lower WHR females, who are more likely to be targeted for dishonest courtship, may be better at identifying disingenuous claims of commitment.","['Attribution', 'Cognition', 'Courtship', 'Psychology', 'Waist–hip ratio', 'Virginity test', 'Trait', 'Empathy', 'Developmental psychology', 'Sexual dimorphism', 'Social psychology', 'Waist', 'Medicine', 'Obesity', 'Endocrinology', 'Psychiatry', 'Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Computer science', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Programming language']","['Jennifer A.

Based on exchange theory, it was expected that greater caregiver resentment would be associated with feeling underbenefited in the relationship and with an orientation to relationships that did not focus on the needs of the partner (communal), but did focus on “tit‐for‐tat” reciprocity (exchange). It was also expected that those caregivers who were more likely to get their needs satisfied in the relationship before the cardiac incident would be more resentful at giving care. Finally, based on attributional theory, it was predicted that caregivers who thought that their spouses were not taking responsibility for improving their health would be more resentful. As predicted, more resentful caregivers were those who felt underbenefited, were more exchange oriented, and judged that their partners were not working toward improving their health. In addition, only those with a low communal orientation toward their spouse showed a relationship between feeling underbenefited and resentment. The needs centrality prediction was not supported. The findings illustrate the utility of applying theories developed in the close relationship area to the understanding of caregiving with chronically ill populations.","['Resentment', 'Feeling', 'Spouse', 'Psychology', 'Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)', 'Social psychology', 'Social exchange theory', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Anthropology', 'Law']","['Suzanne C.

Parents' Causal Attributions Concerning Children's School Achievement: A Longitudinal Study,2005,https://doi.org/10.1353/mpq.2005.0027,51,"The present study investigated the causes to which parents attribute their children's academic successes and failures during children's transition from preschool to primary school. It followed 182 mothers and 167 fathers of 207 children. The parents completed a questionnaire concerning their causal attributions, level of education, and parenting styles in the middle of the preschool year and during Grades 1 and 2. The children's performance in reading and mathematics was tested at the beginning of the preschool year. The results showed that, while the children were in preschool, parents attributed their children's success to ability and teaching. When the children moved to primary school, parents increasingly attributed their children's success to ability, whereas they typically attributed failure to lack of effort. Furthermore, the higher the level of performance the children showed, the more the parents attributed their children's success to ability and the less they attributed it to teaching.","['Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychology', 'Longitudinal study', 'Academic achievement', 'Reading (process)', 'Medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Pathology', 'Political science', 'Law']","['Katja Rytkönen', 'Kaisa Aunola', 'Jari‐Erik Nurmi']",42,False,Merrill-Palmer Quarterly,[],1,85.45015105740181,0.0006709025612691898,0.3333333333333333,0.10046963179288843

Children with learning difficulties and/or motivational and self-esteem difficulties ( n = 29) were identified by their schools. The children then took part in twelve 30-minute group sessions with an educational psychologist, in which the children's attributions were retrained using methods derived from CBT. The intervention appeared to accelerate the children's progress in reading but not in spelling. Significant improvements in motivation and self-esteem were reported by the children and their parents. These changes were less apparent to the teachers. The findings point to a potentially fruitful way of offering additional intervention and support to children with learning difficulties and of increasing attainment.

Two hundred and thirty seven grade 9 high‐ and low‐achieving students from Anglo‐Chinese schools responded to the Academic Achievement Attribution and Learning Process Questionnaires. Both groups attributed academic success and failure more to internal than external causes, but high achievers were higher on achieving motive and approach to learning and low achievers were higher on surface motive and approach. The results of path analysis revealed that the influence of attributions on achievement was mediated by students' motives and strategies for learning. Findings and implications are discussed in relation to the social and cultural context of Hong Kong.

A matrix of relationships linking informational cues and attributional variables was predicted in the first instance, followed by a multivariate relationship between attributions and evaluational variables. To test the hypotheses, 288 subjects responded to 16 descriptions of subordinate performances, varying in consistency, distinctiveness, consensus, and outcome. The results supported the predicted relationships between informational cues and attributions, and between attributions and evaluation. Use of Weiner's (1985) extended model of attribution, which includes dimensions of controllability and intentionality, substantially improved the predictability of the model, especially for explaining failure outcomes.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Luck', 'Optimal distinctiveness theory', 'Schema (genetic algorithms)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science', 'Paleontology', 'Biology']",['Neal M.

Psychopathologies and the Attribution of Charisma: A Critical Introduction to the Psychology of Charisma and the Explanation of Violence in New Religious Movements,2006,https://doi.org/10.1525/nr.2006.10.2.3,50,"ABSTRACT: Charismatic authority is widely held to be a defining mark of new religious movements (NRMs). It is also thought to play a crucial role in the onset of violence in some NRMs. We have begun to understand both the psychological and the social structural dynamices of this mode of leadership and how, under specific social conditions, it contributes to a dangerous cycle of deviance amplification. This paper presents a synthetic and critical analysis of several different theories of the charismatic bond. The central concern is why people attribute charisma to some leaders, and hence grant them special authority over their lives. The theories examined help to explain why charismatic relationships form, but they do not allow us to differentiate sufficiently between benign and potentially dangerous types of charismatic bonds, let alone how one may become the other. Scholars of NRMs need to take a closer look at the observable social psychological processes that prompt the attribution of charisma to a leader. A better grasp of these processes, it is argued, would help us understand how the mismanagement of charismatic authority has led some religious groups to see violence as an appropriate response to their concerns.","['Charisma', 'Deviance (statistics)', 'Charismatic authority', 'Attribution', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Epistemology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Philosophy', 'Computer science', 'Machine learning']",['Lorne L.

It also studies the effects of the severity of a failure on overall blame and the moderating effects of technology anxiety (TA) on the relationship between failure types and overall blame. A paper-based survey with an experimental between-groups design (three types of failures × two levels of severity) was distributed to 300 staff members at a northeastern university in the USA. Customers perceived cause and blame differently. They rated causal attributions the highest in a policy failure and the lowest in an SST failure. Customers saw policy failure as a more external, stable, and controllable cause of problems than an SST failure. When it comes to overall blame to firms, customers are more likely to blame a firm for an SST failure than for an employee failure. The findings of the study suggest that careful attention should be paid to SST failures and emphasize need for zero defects and recovery strategy development for SST failure.","['Blame', 'Attribution', 'Locus of control', 'Business', 'Service (business)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Marketing']","['Boyoun Lee', 'David A.

Quantitative criticism of literary relationships,2017,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611910114,50,"Significance Famous works of literature can serve as cultural touchstones, inviting creative adaptations in subsequent writing. To understand a poem, play, or novel, critics often catalog and analyze these intertextual relationships. The study of such relationships is challenging because intertextuality can take many forms, from direct quotation to literary imitation. Here, we show that techniques from authorship attribution studies, including stylometry and machine learning, can shed light on inexact literary relationships involving little explicit text reuse. We trace the evolution of features not tied to individual words across diverse corpora and provide statistical evidence to support interpretive hypotheses of literary critical interest. The significance of this approach is the integration of quantitative and humanistic methods to address aspects of cultural evolution.","['Intertextuality', 'Stylometry', 'TRACE (psycholinguistics)', 'Imitation', 'Literary criticism', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'Epistemology', 'Criticism', 'Literary science', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Social psychology']","['Joseph P.

Seventy-one subjects (35 men and 36 women) in long-term premarital relationships were asked to imagine 20 hypothetical interactive behaviors within relationships that varied in terms of valency and self- or partner initiation. Subjects then completed a spontaneous attribution probe by stating what they would think and feel in response to each behavior, and these verbal protocols were taped. Causal attributions that occurred in these protocols were later coded as relationship-positive attributions or relationship-negative attributions. Causal judgments were also later directly elicited for each behavior on eight causal dimensions. Replicating previous research, results from both the spontaneous attribution probe and the causal scales suggested that happy partners produce attributions that enhance relationship quality, whereas unhappy partners produce attributions that maintain their current levels of distress. Moreover, regression analyses revealed a unique relation between relationship happiness and attributions that was not mediated by depression or explanatory style, indicating that neither depression nor explanatory style account for the link between attributions and relationship happiness.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Happiness', 'Social psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Association (psychology)', 'Causality (physics)', 'Psychotherapist', 'Physics', 'Archaeology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'History']","['Garth J.

Effectiveness of preventive family intervention in improving cognitive attributions among children of depressed parents: A randomized study.,2013,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0033466,49,"Our randomized trial examined the effectiveness of preventive interventions in increasing positive cognitive attributions and reducing negative cognitive attributions in children of depressed parents. In addition, it tested the role of attribution changes in mediating the intervention effects on children's depressive and emotional symptoms. The participants were 109 Finnish families with at least one parent in treatment for affective disorder, for a total of 145 children, 8-16 years of age. Families were randomized into two groups: the ""family talk intervention"" (FTI, a whole-family approach enhancing communication and child resilience, Beardslee et al., 1997) group, and an active control, the ""let's talk about the children"" (LTC, a parent-only psycho-educational approach, Solantaus, Paavonen, Toikka, & Punamäki, 2010) group. Children reported their cognitive attributions (CASQ-R, Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire-Revised (Thompson, Kaslow, Weiss, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1998)), depressive (CDI/BDI, Child Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1981)/Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988)) and emotional (SDQ, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997)) symptoms, and mothers reported their children's emotional symptoms (SDQ at baseline (T1) and 10-month (T2) and 18-month (T3)) follow-ups. Contrary to our hypothesis, no beneficial attribution changes were found in the FTI group across the follow-ups. Instead, positive cognitive appraisals increased in the LTC group, especially from T2 to T3. The increase of positive attribution further served as a mediator for changes in children's emotional and depressive symptoms. The findings suggest that a short preventive intervention can enhance beneficial cognitive processes in high-risk families in routine adult psychiatric care.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Randomized controlled trial', 'Beck Depression Inventory', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychological intervention', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire', 'Major depressive disorder', 'Psychiatry', 'Developmental psychology', 'Mental health', 'Anxiety', 'Medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Surgery']","['Raija‐Leena Punamäki', 'E.

The present study examined the effect of reactive movements performed by a non-humanoid robot, including different shaped artifact: chair and cube, on the intention attribution.

Authorship attribution of source code by using back propagation neural network based on particle swarm optimization,2017,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187204,49,"Authorship attribution is to identify the most likely author of a given sample among a set of candidate known authors. It can be not only applied to discover the original author of plain text, such as novels, blogs, emails, posts etc., but also used to identify source code programmers. Authorship attribution of source code is required in diverse applications, ranging from malicious code tracking to solving authorship dispute or software plagiarism detection. This paper aims to propose a new method to identify the programmer of Java source code samples with a higher accuracy. To this end, it first introduces back propagation (BP) neural network based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) into authorship attribution of source code. It begins by computing a set of defined feature metrics, including lexical and layout metrics, structure and syntax metrics, totally 19 dimensions. Then these metrics are input to neural network for supervised learning, the weights of which are output by PSO and BP hybrid algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a collected dataset with 3,022 Java files belong to 40 authors. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves 91.060% accuracy.

This was then administered to all the parents of children attending the same inner-city primary school.Factor analysis indicated that parents' attributions for misbehaviour were best represented by three factors: (1) 'fairness of teachers' actions', (2) 'pupil vulnerability to peer influences and adverse family circumstances', and (3) 'differentiation of classroom demands and expectations'. While there were no differences between parents in terms of gender or ethnicity, they did see the first two factors as more significant contributors to pupil misbehaviour than the third.There is both agreement and conflict between parents' attributions and those made by pupils and by teachers. The implementation of policy initiatives, such as home-school agreements and Pastoral Support Programmes, risk exacerbating tensions and difficulties if these differences in attributions are not acknowledged and acted upon.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Ethnic group', 'Developmental psychology', 'Pupil', 'Vulnerability (computing)', 'Social psychology', 'Computer security', 'Neuroscience', 'Sociology', 'Anthropology', 'Computer science']","['Andy Miller', 'Eamonn Ferguson', 'Eleanor Moore']",0,False,British Journal of Educational Psychology,[],1,84.8710976837865,0.0006445926569056921,0.3333333333333333,0.10045121485983398

Attribution of Somatic Symptoms in Hypochondriasis,2013,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.1871,49,"The misinterpretation of bodily symptoms as an indicator of a serious illness is a key feature of the criteria and the cognitive–behavioural models of hypochondriasis. Previous research suggests that individuals suffering from health anxiety endorse attributions of physical disease, whereas persons with elevated general anxiety have the tendency to attribute psychological causes to their symptoms. However, whether a somatic attribution style is specific to patients with hypochondriasis, as opposed to those with anxiety disorders, has not yet been investigated and is therefore part of the present study. Fifty patients with hypochondriasis, 50 patients with a primary anxiety disorder and 50 healthy participants were presented with nine common bodily sensations and had to spontaneously attribute possible causes to the symptoms. Patients with hypochondriasis differed from patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls in giving significantly fewer normalizing explanations, but attributing more often in terms of moderate or serious diseases. Patients with anxiety disorders also made significantly fewer normalizing attributions and more somatic attributions to a severe illness than healthy controls. There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of psychological attributions and somatic attributions concerning mild diseases. The present study demonstrates that hypochondriasis is associated with a disorder‐specific attribution style connecting somatic symptoms primarily with moderate and serious diseases. By contrast, normalizing attributions are largely omitted from consideration by patients with hypochondriasis. The findings conform with the cognitive conception of hypochondriasis and support the strategy of modifying symptom attributions, as practiced in cognitive–behavioural therapy.

"Understanding attributional biases, emotions and self‐esteem in poor me paranoia: Findings from an early psychosis sample",2008,https://doi.org/10.1348/014466508x377135,49,"Trower and Chadwick's (1995) theory of two types of paranoia ('poor me' and 'bad me') provides a framework for understanding the seemingly contradictory evidence on persecutory delusions. Paranoia has been argued to defend against low self-esteem, but people with persecutory delusions report high levels of emotional distress and, in some instances, low self-worth. The current study investigates attributions and emotions in a sample of people with early psychosis who have persecutory delusions. 'Poor me' paranoia has been found to be more frequent than 'bad me' paranoia in the early stages of psychosis. Anger and a tendency to blame other people are hypothesized to characterize 'poor me' paranoia.The study had a cross-sectional design. Twenty individuals with early psychosis, 21 clinical controls with depression and 32 healthy volunteers completed a thorough assessment of emotions and attributions.The 'poor me' paranoia group showed higher levels of anger, anxiety and depression than the non-clinical control group. Self-esteem and guilt were however preserved. A tendency to blame others but not themselves was characteristic of the 'poor me' paranoia group whereas people in the clinical control group tended to self-blame for failures. Anger, but not self-esteem, was associated with an attributional bias characterized by blaming other people instead of oneself.In conclusion, anger, a previously overlooked emotion in the study of persecutory delusions, warrants further attention. The other-directed nature of this emotion highlights the potential role of interpersonal schemas in understanding paranoia.","['Paranoia', 'Psychology', 'Anger', 'Attribution', 'Psychosis', 'Blame', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Anxiety', 'Delusion', 'Distress', 'Clinical psychology', 'Attribution bias', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology']","['Miriam Fornells‐Ambrojo', 'Philippa Garety']",75,False,British Journal of Clinical Psychology,[],1,84.8710976837865,0.0006445926569056921,0.3333333333333333,0.10045121485983398
Bridging the gap between DeafBlind minds: interactional and social foundations of intention attribution in the Seattle DeafBlind community,2015,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01497,49,"This article is concerned with social and interactional processes that simplify pragmatic acts of intention attribution. The empirical focus is a series of interactions among DeafBlind people in Seattle, Washington, where pointing signs are used to individuate objects of reference in the immediate environment. Most members of this community are born deaf and slowly become blind. They come to Seattle using Visual American Sign Language, which has emerged and developed in a field organized around visual modes of access. As vision deteriorates, however, links between deictic signs (such as pointing) and the present, remembered, or imagined environment erode in idiosyncratic ways across the community of language-users, and as a result, it becomes increasingly difficult for participants to converge on objects of reference. In the past, DeafBlind people addressed this problem by relying on sighted interpreters. Under the influence of the recent ""pro-tactile"" movement, they have turned instead to one another to find new solutions to these referential problems. Drawing on analyses of 120 h of videorecorded interaction and language-use, detailed fieldnotes collected during 12 months of sustained anthropological fieldwork, and more than 15 years of involvement in this community in a range of capacities, I argue that DeafBlind people are generating new and reciprocal modes of access to their environment, and this process is aligning language with context in novel ways. I discuss two mechanisms that can account for this process: embedding in the social field and deictic integration. I argue that together, these social and interactional processes yield a deictic system set to retrieve a restricted range of values from the extra-linguistic context, thereby attenuating the cognitive demands of intention attribution and narrowing the gap between DeafBlind minds.","['Deixis', 'Psychology', 'Fieldnotes', 'Sign language', 'Interpreter', 'Attribution', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Social relation', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Communication', 'Sociology', 'Computer science', 'Paleontology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Ethnography', 'Biology', 'Programming language']",['Terra Edwards'],57,True,Frontiers in Psychology,['Wenner-Gren Foundation'],1,84.8710976837865,0.0006445926569056921,0.3333333333333333,0.10045121485983398

B i n C o m p has a stratified architecture with three layers. The first layer applies a supervised compilation process to a set of known programs to model the default code transformation of compilers. The second layer employs an intersection process that disassembles functions across compiled binaries to extract statistical features (e.g., numerical values) from common compiler/linker-inserted functions. This layer labels the compiler-related functions. The third layer extracts semantic features from the labeled compiler-related functions to identify the compiler version and the optimization level. Our experimental results demonstrate that B i n C o m p is efficient in terms of both computational resources and time.","['Compiler', 'Computer science', 'Compiler correctness', 'Compiler construction', 'Optimizing compiler', 'Interprocedural optimization', 'Programming language', 'Loop optimization', 'Semantics (computer science)']","['Ashkan Rahimian', 'Paria Shirani', 'Saed Alrbaee', 'Lingyu Wang', 'Mourad Debbabi']",22,True,Digital Investigation,[],1,84.8710976837865,0.0006445926569056921,0.3333333333333333,0.10045121485983398

Meaningful attributional accounts were uncovered; in particular, performance outcome and task difficulty had independent effects on subjects' attributional judgments. Cognitive interference was implicated as a factor contributing to the attributional predispositions of persons differing in test anxiety, and it was a major determinant of affective reactions. In addition, subjects' affective responses were predictably associated with their perceived performance outcome, their level of test anxiety, the difficulty of the task, and subjects' attributional accounts of the factors influencing their performance.

Results of two cross-sectional studies (Study 1, N=1066 and Study 2, N=419) converge to indicate that collective narcissism predicts hostility towards Syrian refugees via attributing Syrian refugees with hostile intentions towards Poles. In-group satisfaction is associated with rejection of hostile actions towards Syrian refugees because it decreases hostile attribution bias with regards to Syrian refugees. Thus, being a satisfied member of a national group promotes tolerance towards refugees, while collective narcissism is associated with blaming refugees for provoking the in-group's hostility.","['Psychology', 'Hostility', 'Attribution', 'Narcissism', 'Social psychology', 'Refugee', 'Group (periodic table)', 'Chemistry', 'Archaeology', 'Organic chemistry', 'History']","['Karolina Dyduch‐Hazar', 'Błażej Mroziński', 'Agnieszka Golec de Zavala']",53,True,Frontiers in Psychology,['Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],1,84.57737495803961,0.0006314377047239434,0.3333333333333333,0.10044200639330675

"She Dresses to Attract, He Perceives Seduction: A Gender Gap in Attribution of Intent to Women’s Revealing Style of Dress and its Relation to Blaming the Victims of Sexual Violence",2010,,48,"Abstract Victims of sexual violence are often blamed for precipitating their own assault with their so-called provocative body-revealing style of dress, which is viewed as conveying consent for sexual advances. To explore some of the grounds for this allegation as well as its accurateness, the present study examines the attributions made by both sexes regarding the motivation for women's sexualized appearance. The factual connection between revealing clothing and actual occurrences of sexual invasions is examined as well. The results demonstrate a gender-based attribution gap wherein men report perceiving the sexualized look as indicating an interest in sex and intent to seduce, whereas women cite their wish to feel and look attractive as its primary cause, while entirely rejecting the seduction claim. This gap is examined in the context of the current widespread sexual objectification of women and the social construction of female beauty in sexual terms, as well as the finding that in reality there is no connection between style of dress and sexual victimization of any sort. Keywords: Misperception of sexual intent, Rape myths, Body-revealing appearance ********** Blaming the victim of sexual violence for precipitating her own victimization is a rather common practice in present society (Ardovini-Brooker & Caringella-MacDonald, 2002; Burt, 1980; Cowan, 2000; De Judicibus & McCabe, 2001; Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994; Kopper, 1996; Koss & Harvey, 1991). These stereotyped attitudes, generally subsumed in the term myths (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994), typically revolve around the notion that victims somehow contributed to their own victimization and are therefore responsible for its occurrence (Koss & Harvey, 1991). Perpetrators frequently use these claims in their defense, and society is all too willing, even eager, to cooperate with this line of argumentation and lay the bulk of the blame on those who were attacked.

One client exhibited CB, while the other did not, giving 2 samples. Attributional and EE ratings for each group were compared. This study did not employ vignette methodology.Staff working with a client with learning disabilities and CB attributed the CB as internal to the client and controllable by the client. Staff reported high levels of EE and made more critical comments towards the client with CB as compared with the client without CB. Furthermore, staff who reported high EE attributed CB as internal to the client and controllable by the client.Staff working with a client with challenging behaviour appeared to be making the 'fundamental attribution error'.

An application of attribution principles to nonverbal behavior in romantic dyads,1990,https://doi.org/10.1080/03637759009376189,48,"This article suggests ways in which attribution theories can explain the interpretation processes involved in understanding nonverbal behavior. An experiment examined attribution choices for nonverbal messages between romantic partners. Couples (N = 63) were videotaped while playing a game of “Trivial Pursuit.” During the interaction, one member of the dyad manipulated his or her nonverbal behaviors to appear positive at one point and negative at a second time period. If noticed, the partner made attributions for these behaviors. It was found that level of relational satisfaction correlated with perceptions of cause for nonverbal messages. In particular, negative behaviors were seen to be more intentional, stable, and controllable, whereas positive cues were perceived to be more external, unstable, and specific as relational satisfaction decreased. Further, satisfied couples were more likely to offer neutral motives for the negative behaviors of their partners. Overall, negative behaviors more commonly elicited overt attributions than did positive or baseline cues, but the number of attributions provided to account for the behaviors increased along with satisfaction level.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Nonverbal communication', 'Dyad', 'Social psychology', 'Perception', 'Romance', 'Developmental psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychoanalysis']",['Valerie Manusov'],75,False,Communication Monographs,[],1,84.57737495803961,0.0006314377047239434,0.3333333333333333,0.10044200639330675

The one-to-one correspondence between these ""syntax-embedding"" vectors and the words (hence their embedding vectors) in the sentence makes it easy to integrate such a representation with all word-level NLP models.

Why Context Matters: The Influence of Application Domain on Preferred Degree of Anthropomorphism and Gender Attribution in Human–Robot Interaction,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-021-00860-z,48,"Abstract The application of anthropomorphic design features is widely believed to facilitate human–robot interaction. However, the preference for robots’ anthropomorphism is highly context sensitive, as different application domains induce different expectations towards robots. In this study the influence of application domain on the preferred degree of anthropomorphism is examined. Moreover, as anthropomorphic design can reinforce existing gender stereotypes of different work domains, gender associations were investigated. Therefore, participants received different context descriptions and subsequently selected and named one robot out of differently anthropomorphic robots in an online survey. The results indicate that lower degrees of anthropomorphism are preferred in the industrial domain and higher degrees of anthropomorphism in the social domain, whereas no clear preference was found in the service domain. Unexpectedly, mainly functional names were ascribed to the robots and if human names were chosen, male names were given more frequently than female names even in the social domain. The results support the assumption that the preferred degree of anthropomorphism depends on the context. Hence, the sociability of a domain might determine to what extent anthropomorphic design features are suitable. Furthermore, the results indicate that robots are overall associated more functional, than gendered (and if gendered then masculine). Therefore, the design features of robots should enhance functionalities, rather than specific gendered anthropomorphic attributes to avoid stereotypes and not further reinforce the association of masculinity and technology.","['Preference', 'Robot', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Domain (mathematical analysis)', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Human–robot interaction', 'Robotics', 'Social psychology', 'Degree (music)', 'Computer science', 'Masculinity', 'Human–computer interaction', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Mathematics', 'Geography', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Statistics', 'Physics', 'Archaeology', 'Acoustics', 'Psychoanalysis']","['Eileen Roesler', 'Lara Naendrup-Poell', 'Dietrich Manzey', 'Linda Onnasch']",39,True,International Journal of Social Robotics,['Technische Universität Berlin'],1,84.57737495803961,0.0006314377047239434,0.3333333333333333,0.10044200639330675

Perpetual ingroup victimhood as a distorted lens: Effects on attribution and categorization,2017,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2250,47,"Abstract Although the effects of group‐based victimhood on attitudes and emotions have been demonstrated in previous research, the ways it affects cognitive processes remain unclear. Four studies examined how a perpetual ingroup victimhood orientation (PIVO) affects cognitive biases. High levels of PIVO were associated with the categorization of more outgroups as hostile to the ingroup, and more rapid responses when using an enmity criterion (Study 1). PIVO was also associated with more attributions of malevolent intentions and fewer attributions of neutral intentions to outgroup members in ambiguous situations (Study 2a); when primed with reminders of historical group trauma, attribution of malevolent intentions increased among high‐ but not low‐ PIVO individuals (Study 2b). However, the effect extended to all participants when using a larger sample (Study 2c). The implications of these categorization and attributional biases are discussed in particular as regards the self‐perpetuating nature of perceived group victimhood.","['Ingroups and outgroups', 'Psychology', 'Categorization', 'Attribution', 'Outgroup', 'Social psychology', 'Cognition', 'Attribution bias', 'Social cognition', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience']","['Noa Schori‐Eyal', 'Yechiel Klar', 'Yarden Ben‐Ami']",90,False,European Journal of Social Psychology,['Israel Science Foundation'],1,84.27291037260825,0.0006182827525421945,0.3333333333333333,0.10043279792677953

The authors further examined whether these predictive and genetic links varied across levels of stress, age, and gender. Negative attributions preceded, co-occurred with, and followed symptoms. The predictive association between earlier negative attributions and later depressive symptoms did not differ by stress, age, or gender.

We also examined whether these reactions are congruent with that predicted by attribution theory. Methods Using a repeated measures design, 60 staff working with children who have severe intellectual disabilities completed measures of cognition, emotion and helping behaviour in reaction to a ‘real’ incident of CB, and then completed the same measures in reaction to reading a ‘vignette’, that was matched to the ‘real’ incident of CB. There was a 2‐week interval between the completion of measures in response to the ‘real’ incident of CB and the ‘vignette’. Results Correlational support was found for Weiner’s (1980) cognitive–emotional–action model of helping behaviour for measures completed in reaction to the ‘real’ incident of CB, regarding attributions of control only, but not for the ‘vignette’. There were significant differences between the correlations detected using ‘real’ incidents of CB in comparison to ‘vignettes’. Little evidence was found using both methods to support Weiner’s (1979) model of achievement motivation. Conclusions The results suggest that the relationships between constructs investigated using ‘vignettes’ is different from that detected when using ‘real’ incidents of CB, which has implications for psychological research that has used ‘vignettes’.","['Vignette', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Challenging behaviour', 'Intellectual disability', 'Cognition', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Learning disability', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Victoria L.

Data were collected from 640 Chinese and Western customers using scenario-based experiments in a restaurant context to assess the hypothesized relationships in the model. Findings The findings show that compared to service delivery success, customers tend to hold service employee and firm responsible for service delivery failure rather than themselves and cultural differences. Moreover, personal cultural orientations partially moderated the influence of the service delivery outcome on customer attributions. Research limitations/implications Future research could adopt different methodologies such as critical incident techniques and surveys to replicate the study. Practical implications Service firms are recommended to design programs to influence customer attributions such as “customer education programs” and “customer appreciation programs” to achieve high customer satisfaction.

It also sheds light on the potential moderating role of personal cultural orientations on the relationship between service delivery outcome and customer attributions.","['Attribution', 'Service delivery framework', 'Marketing', 'Psychology', 'Service (business)', 'Business', 'Customer advocacy', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Customer satisfaction', 'Service quality', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Biology']","['Jackie L.M.

"Teachers’ Attributions of Causality, Control and Responsibility in Respect of Difficult Pupil Behaviour and its Successful Management",1995,https://doi.org/10.1080/0144341950150408,46,"Abstract It is now almost a quarter of a century since the publication of the first paper demonstrating the effects of a behavioural approach within a British school setting (Ward, 1971). In the intervening period, a succession of papers, mostly in the form of case studies, have extended such work. However, accounts have also frequently drawn attention to the fact that such methods do not always correspond with teachers’ more intuitive approaches to the behaviour of pupils they deem difficult to manage. This paper considers the various attempts that have been made to synthesise behavioural approaches with other theoretical frameworks in order to understand better these recurring problems of implementation within educational settings. One prominent psychological perspective that has been relatively neglected from these considerations is that of attribution theory. This paper reports on an interview study of 24 primary age‐range teachers who had successfully adopted a behavioural approach to a difficult pupil in consultation with an educational psychologist (EP). An analysis is made of these teachers’ attributions for the origins of the pupils’ behaviour and for the improvements that are achieved. The results indicate that different models of attribution are applied by the teachers to the pupils, parents and themselves, suggesting that for sustained and generalisable improvements, EPs may need to take a much more explicit and detailed approach to teachers’ construing of difficult behaviour as well as their actions in response to it.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Pupil', 'Control (management)', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Neuroscience', 'Computer science', 'Management', 'Economics']",['Andy Miller'],28,False,Educational Psychology,[],1,83.9640819066801,0.0006051278003604457,0.3333333333333333,0.1004235894602523
"Subjective HIV attribution theories, coping and psychological functioning among homosexual men with HIV",1998,https://doi.org/10.1080/713612416,46,"Facing a traumatic event, such as being diagnosed with HIV, the individual tries to find an explanation why the traumatic event happened. One way to answer that question is through attributions. The purpose of this study was to examine subjective attribution theories for HIV (internal/self-blame, external/blaming others, and fatalistic) and their association with coping styles and psychological functioning among 57 self-defined gay men who were HIV-positive. None of the respondents were diagnosed with AIDS. Although all men made attributions for their HIV infection, few had incorporated exclusively self-blame and external attributions, respectively. About one-third of the gay men attributed HIV to both self-blame and external factors. Self-blame attribution was associated with the avoidant coping style. Analyses yielded that both self-blame attribution and the avoidant coping style correlated with depressive mood and life dissatisfaction. External attribution theory displayed a positive relation to depressive mood. No particular HIV attribution theory was tied to good psychological functioning. The clinical implications of these results are discussed.","['Attribution', 'Blame', 'Psychology', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Mood', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Ulrich Clement', 'Lena Nilsson Schönnesson']",0,False,AIDS Care,[],1,83.9640819066801,0.0006051278003604457,0.3333333333333333,0.1004235894602523

Following the assessment of intelligence, self-concept, and causal attributions, 150 children from each of grades 3 and 5 were given a metamemory interview and a sort-recall task. Metamemory, strategy, and recall scores increased with age. Causal modelling (LISREL) analyses using latent variables were conducted to assess the effects of the constructs intelligence and ""hope of success"" (i.e., the attributional and self-concept variables) on metamemory and memory behaviour. Hope of success significantly influenced metamemory and memory performance in the older children, but not in third graders. However, intelligence had an impact on metamemory in all age groups. But since metamemory still had a significant direct effect on memory behaviour, the study provides support for the assumption that metamemory remains an important predictor of memory behaviour even after the influence of conceptually related constructs has been taken into account.","['Metamemory', 'Psychology', 'Recall', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Metacognition', 'Cognition', 'Neuroscience']","['Wolfgang Schneider', 'Joachim Kérkel', 'Franz Emanuel Weinert']",22,False,International Journal of Behavioral Development,[],1,83.9640819066801,0.0006051278003604457,0.3333333333333333,0.1004235894602523

According to an initial theoretical model, attributions are directly related to expectancies, and expectancies are directly related to depression, but attributions are only indirectly related to depression by means of their relation to expectancies. The results of Study 1 indicated that this model was flawed in 2 respects: (a) Attributions for positive and negative events did not form a single latent variable, and (b) attributions for negative events both were indirectly related to depression by means of expectancies and were directly related to depression. Attributions for positive events only were indirectly related to depression by means of expectancies. The model derived in Study 1 was replicated in Study 2. Discussion centers on the interpretation of this modified model and on issues in the measurement of attributional style.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Depression (economics)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social psychology', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'History', 'Statistics', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology']","['Jay G.

This is in order to increase the portability of the software to different types of texts. We test the methodology on a corpus of undisputed English texts, and use leave-one-out cross validation to demonstrate classification accuracies in excess of 90%. We further test our methods on the Federalist Papers, which have a partly disputed authorship and a fair degree of scholarly consensus. And finally, we apply our methodology to the question of the authorship of the Letter to the Hebrews by comparing it against a number of original Greek texts of known authorship. These tests identify where some of the limitations lie, motivating a number of open questions for future work.
