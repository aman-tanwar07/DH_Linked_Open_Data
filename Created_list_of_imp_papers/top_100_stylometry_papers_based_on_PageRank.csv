The Effectiveness of Stemming in the Stylometric Authorship Attribution in Arabic,2020,https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2020.0110114,20,"The recent years have witnessed the development of numerous approaches to authorship attribution including statistical and linguistic methods. Stylometric authorship attribution, however, remains among the most widely used due to its accuracy and effectiveness. Nevertheless, many authorship problems remain unresolved in terms of Arabic. This can be attributed to different factors including linguistic peculiarities that are not usually considered in standard authorship systems. In the case of Arabic, the morphological features carry unique stylistic features that can be usefully used in testing authorship in controversial texts and writings. The hypothesis is that much of these morphological features are lost due to the execution of stemming. As such, this study is concerned with investigating the effectiveness of stemming in the stylometric applications to authorship attribution in Arabic. In so doing, three Arabic stemmers GOLD stemmer, Khoga stemmer, Light 10 stemmer are used. By way of illustration, a corpus of 2400 news articles written by different 97 authors is designed. To evaluate the effectiveness of stemming, the selected articles (both stemmed and unstemmed texts) are clustered using cluster analysis methods. Comparisons are made between clustering structures based on stemmed and unstemmed datasets. The results indicate that stemming has negative impacts on the accuracy of the clustering performance and thus on the reliability of stylometric authorship testing in Arabic. The peculiar stylistic features of the affixation processes in Arabic can, thus, be usefully used for improving the performance of authorship attribution applications in Arabic. It can be finally concluded that stemming is not effective in the stylometric authorship applications in Arabic.","['Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Natural language processing', 'Arabic', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Cluster analysis', 'Attribution', 'Linguistics', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Wafya Ibrahim']",33,True,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0
Stylometric Authorship Attribution for the Middle Dutch Mystical Tradition from Groenendaal,2016,https://doi.org/10.1080/03096564.2016.1252077,5,"The well-known medieval Groenendaal monastery in Brabant has produced some of the finest examples of medieval Dutch literature, including Jan van Ruusbroec's œuvre, who together with Anne Frank, remains the most frequently translated Dutch author of all time. Authorship attribution nevertheless remains a serious scholarly concern when it comes to the corpus of mystical texts from Groenendaal: because of the general proximity of the Groenendaal authors, their œuvres can be difficult to delineate. In this paper, I apply a quantitative, style-based methodology for authorship attribution to a sizable corpus of Groenendaal authors. These computational techniques are borrowed from the innovative field of stylometry in the Digital Humanities. I will discuss how the experimental results obtained are able to confirm and complement many of the authorship-related hypotheses developed in traditional Middle Dutch studies. Additionally, this work aims to demonstrate the exciting scholarly potential of 'Distant Reading' for the study of the rich textual heritage from the medieval Low Countries.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Mysticism', 'Attribution', 'Reading (process)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Literature', 'Field (mathematics)', 'History', 'Epistemology', 'Linguistics', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics']",['Mike Kestemont'],15,False,Dutch Crossing,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0
Stylometry and Automatic Attribution of Medieval Liturgical Monodies,2018,https://doi.org/10.4000/ijcol.518,0,"While automatic attribution of literary text as well as stylometry evaluation are nowadays well-established research areas, much less has been done in the field of musicology. Here we present the results of the implementation of an automatic stylometric attribution technique to a corpus of liturgical monodies of medieval origin (the so-called Gregorian Chant, Old Roman Chant and Ambrosian Chant). The 'unidimensional' nature of the musical repertoires investigated (rhythm-free melody without accompaniment) allows the adoption of a known method based on a pseudo-distance between frequency-vectors of n-gram of consecutive symbols. Finally, we show that some specific features of musicological interest inside the three liturgical families can be naturally extracted using a statistical analysis of n-gram distributions. The results presented show that a quantitative approach is well suited to support and accompany the investigation of refined problems in musicology.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Art', 'Natural language processing', 'Psychology', 'Computer science', 'Social psychology']","['Francesco Unguendoli', 'Giampaolo Cristadoro', 'Marco Beghelli']",6,True,Italian Journal of Computational Linguistics,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0

"Robert Musil, a war journal, and stylometry: Tackling the issue of short texts in authorship attribution",2018,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy055,20,"Abstract During World War I (WWI), between 1916 and 1917, Robert Musil was the chief editor of the Tiroler Soldaten-Zeitung in Bozen. This activity probably also involved authorship of articles and has posed a philological problem to scholars, who have not been able to attribute with certainty a range of relatively short texts to Musil. With this article, we present a new approach that combines philological research with stylometric methods. Exploration of WWI archives and digitization of historical documents were paired with application of authorship attribution techniques, following extensive evaluation. To build the training set, we adapted the ‘impostors method’ by grouping three ‘distractor authors’ (similar to Musil in terms of style) and three actual candidates for authorship. In the test set, we developed two designs for tackling the issue of text length: a combinatory design, where longer chunks were composed by the juxtaposition of short texts; a simplified design, where the texts for attribution were merged with already attributed texts. Results of our experiment suggest that Musil attribution may be disproved with a high level of confidence for ten texts that were more probably written by a less well-known author, Albert Ritter. We carried out a keyness analysis on the specific words preferred or avoided by the two authors, which not only corroborated the results of the quantitative analysis but also findings from Musil philology. Our study showcases the potentialities of using mixed methods in stylometry.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Philology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Certainty', 'Computer science', 'Literature', 'History', 'Art', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Feminism', 'Social psychology', 'Programming language']","['Simone Rebora', 'J.

$CAG$ : Stylometric Authorship Attribution of Multi-Author Documents Using a Co-Authorship Graph,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.2967449,19,"Stylometry has been successfully applied to perform authorship identification of single-author documents (AISD). The AISD task is concerned with identifying the original author of an anonymous document from a group of candidate authors. However, AISD techniques are not applicable to the authorship identification of multi-author documents (AIMD). Unlike AISD, where each document is written by one single author, AIMD focuses on handling multi-author documents. Due to the combinatoric nature of documents, AIMD lacks the ground truth information-that is, information on writing and non-writing authors in a multi-author document-which makes this problem more challenging to solve. Previous AIMD solutions have a number of limitations: (i) the best stylometry-based AIMD solution has a low accuracy, less than 30%; (ii) increasing the number of co-authors of papers adversely affects the performance of AIMD solutions; and (iii) AIMD solutions were not designed to handle the non-writing authors (NWAs). However, NWAs exist in real-world cases-that is, there are papers for which not every co-author listed has contributed as a writer. This paper proposes an AIMD framework called the Co-Authorship Graph that can be used to (i) capture the stylistic information of each author in a corpus of multi-author documents and (ii) make a multi-label prediction for a multi-author query document. We conducted extensive experimental studies on one synthetic and three real-world corpora. Experimental results show that our proposed framework (i) significantly outperformed competitive techniques; (ii) can effectively handle a larger number of co-authors in comparison with competitive techniques; and (iii) can effectively handle NWAs in multi-author documents.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Information retrieval', 'Identification (biology)', 'Task (project management)', 'Graph', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Botany', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Raheem Sarwar', 'Norawit Urailertprasert', 'Nattapol Vannaboot', 'Chenyun Yu', 'Thanawin Rakthanmanon', 'Ekapol Chuangsuwanich', 'Sarana Nutanong']",55,True,IEEE Access,['Thailand Research Fund'],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0
Authorship Attribution of Short Historical Arabic Texts using Stylometric Features and a KNN Classifier with Limited Training Data,2020,https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2020.1334.1345,1,"Authorship Attribution (AA) is a task that aims to recognize the authorship of unknown texts based on writing style. Out of the various approaches to solve the AA problem, Stylometry is a promising one. This paper explores the use of a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier combined with stylometry features to perform AA. This study indicates the robustness of KNN in performing AA on short historical Arabic texts written by different authors. To classify the texts according to the author, KNN was trained with a set of stylometry features including rare words, count characters and 2-, 3- and 4-grams character levels. Various feature set sizes ranging from 34 to 2000 were tested in the experiment. The experiments were conducted on limited training data with datasets consisting of 3 short texts per the author’s book. This method proved to be at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) when selecting the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the KNN classifier achieved high accuracy results with the best classification accuracy of up to 90%, except for the 5-KK using the 4-gram character level. This work contributes towards utilizing KNN for identifying the distinctive stylometry feature for robust AA identification in short historical Arabic texts.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Training set', 'Arabic', 'Natural language processing', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Writing style', 'k-nearest neighbors algorithm', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy']","['Fatma Howedi', 'Masnizah Mohd', 'Zahra Aborawi Aborawi', 'Salah A.

Gender Attribution: Tracing Stylometric Evidence Beyond Topic and Genre,2011,,106,"Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973)) postulate that women's language styles differ from that of men. In this paper, we explore statistical techniques that can learn to identify the gender of authors in modern English text, such as web blogs and scientific papers. Although recent work has shown the efficacy of statistical approaches to gender attribution, we conjecture that the reported performance might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic factors such as topic bias in gender that can make the gender detection task easier. Our work is the first that consciously avoids gender bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evidence to gender-specific styles in language beyond topic.

Authorship attribution of Morsi Gameel Aziz’s lyrics: A clustering-based stylometry approach,2021,https://doi.org/10.52462/jlls.36,2,"Numerous studies have addressed the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics. These studies have traditionally been based on chronological criteria for determining the real authors of disputed lyrics. To date, there is no agreement on the real authors of these disputed lyrics. This can mainly be attributed to both selectivity and the lack of empirical evidence in such studies, raising questions about the reliability of such approaches. With the advent of machine learning systems and data mining techniques, it is now possible to process thousands of texts using replicable methods. Thus, this study seeks to address the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics making use of these advances by applying a clustering-based stylometry approach. The hypothesis is that lyrics grouped or clustered together are more likely to be written by the same poet. A corpus of 1,089 lyrics was built, including all known lyrics attributed to Aziz and the lyrics of the poets thought to be the real authors of the disputed lyrics. The lyrics were clustered using the Gibbs sampling Dirichlet multinomial mixture (GSDMM) technique, and were assigned to 4 main classes, with the 12 disputed lyrics clustered within Azizâ€™s class. Based on this, it is clear that the GSDMM model is effective and reliable in clustering short documents in Arabic. The results of the study show that machine learning systems and stylometric authorship techniques can be used in resolving many authorship questions that remain controversial and unanswered in Arabic literature.","['Lyrics', 'Stylometry', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Art']",['Abdulfattah Omar'],59,True,Journal of Language and Linguistic Studies,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0

Dropping down the Maximum Item Set: Improving the Stylometric Authorship Attribution Algorithm in the Text Mining for Authorship Investigation,2010,https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2010.235.243,6,"Problem statement: Stylometric authorship attribution is an approach concerned about analyzing texts in text mining, e.g., novels and plays that famous authors wrote, trying to measure the authors style, by choosing some attributes that shows the author style of writing, assuming that these writers have a special way of writing that no other writer has; thus, authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. In this study, we propose an authorship attribution algorithm, improving the accuracy of Stylometric features of different professionals so it can be discriminated nearly as well as fingerprints of different persons using authorship attributes.

Results: To improve the techniques of the AA, we need to use new pack of attributes with a new measurement tool, the first pack of attributes we are using in this study is the (frequent pair) which means a pair of words that always appear together, this attribute clearly is not a new one, but it wasn't a successive attribute compared with the frequent word, using the maximum item set counters. the words pair made some mistakes as we see in the experiment results, improving the winnow algorithm by combining it with the computational approach, achieved by us","['Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Stylometry', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Task (project management)', 'Statement (logic)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Word (group theory)', 'Ranking (information retrieval)', 'Rank (graph theory)', 'Data mining', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'History', 'Programming language', 'Mathematics', 'Combinatorics']",['Mustafa'],9,True,Journal of Computer Science,[],3,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,1.0,1.0

We suggest a new, simple and efficient method, which is merely based on counting the number of repetitions of each alphabetic letter in the text, instead of using the traditional classification properties; such as the contents of the text and style of the author; which falls into four feature categories: lexical, syntactic, structural, and content-specific. Furthermore, we apply a spherical classification method. We apply the proposed technique to the work of two Italian writers, Dante Alighieri and Brunetto Latini. With almost high reliability, the spherical classifier proved its ability to discriminate between the selected authors.

Adversarial stylometry,2012,https://doi.org/10.1145/2382448.2382450,183,"The use of stylometry, authorship recognition through purely linguistic means, has contributed to literary, historical, and criminal investigation breakthroughs. Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation , where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation , where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67% of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks.

Finding characteristic features in stylometric analysis,2015,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqv048,7,"The usual focus in authorship studies is on authorship attribution, i.e. determining which author (of a given set) wrote a piece of unknown provenance. The usual setting involves a small number of candidate authors, which means that the focus quickly revolves around a search for features that discriminate among the candidates. Whether the features that serve to discriminate among the authors are characteristic is then not of primary importance. We respectfully suggest an alternative in this article, namely a focus on seeking features that are characteristic for an author with respect to others. To determine an author’s characteristic features, we first seek elements that he or she uses consistently, which we therefore regard as ‘representative’, but we likewise seek elements which the author uses ‘distinctively’ in comparison to an opposing author. We test the idea on a task recently proposed that compares Charles Dickens to both Wilkie Collins and a larger reference set comprising several authors’ works from the 18th and 19th century. We then compare the use of representative and distinctive features to Burrows’ ‘Delta’ and Hoovers’ ‘CoV Tuning’; we find that our method bears little similarity with either method in terms of characteristic feature selection. We show that our method achieves reliable and consistent results in the two-author comparison and fair results in the multi-author one, measured by separation ability in clustering.","['Focus (optics)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Stylometry', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Computer science', 'Task (project management)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Cluster analysis', 'Selection (genetic algorithm)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Natural language processing', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Linguistics', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Engineering', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Systems engineering', 'Optics', 'Programming language']","['Carmen Klaussner', 'John Nerbonne', 'Çağrı Çöltekin']",21,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Towards a Linguistic Stylometric Model for the Authorship Detection in Cybercrime Investigations,2019,https://doi.org/10.5539/ijel.v9n5p182,6,"This study proposes an integrated framework that considers letter-pair frequencies/combinations along with the lexical features of documents as a means to identifying the authorship of short texts posted anonymously on social media. Taking a quantitative morpho-lexical approach, this study tests the hypothesis that letter information, or mapping, can identify unique stylistic features. As such, stable word combinations and morphological patterns can be used successfully for authorship detection in relation to very short texts. This method offers significant potential in the fight against online hate speech, which is often posted anonymously and where authorship is difficult to identify. The data analyzed is from a corpus of 12,240 tweets derived from 87 Twitter accounts. A self-organizing map (SOM) model was used to classify input patterns in the tweets that shared common features. Tweets grouped in a particular class displayed features that suggested they were written by a particular author. The results indicate that the accuracy of classification according to the proposed system was around 76%. Up to 22% of this accuracy was lost, however, when only distinctive words were used and 26% was lost when the classification procedure was based solely on letter combinations and morphological patterns. The integration of letter-pairs and morphological patterns had the advantage of improving accuracy when determining the author of a given tweet. This indicates that the integration of different linguistic variables into an integrated system leads to better performance in classifying very short texts. It is also clear that the use of a self-organizing map (SOM) led to better clustering performance because of its capacity to integrate two different linguistic levels for each author profile.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Class (philosophy)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Word (group theory)', 'Part of speech', 'Stylometry', 'Relation (database)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Data mining', 'Philosophy']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Aldawsari Bader Deraan']",25,True,International Journal of English Linguistics,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

The texts from different authors were represented by tones, tone motifs, and word length motifs as well as rimes and rime motifs. Support vector machines and random forests were used to establish the text classification model for authorship attribution. From the results of the experiments, we conclude that the combination of bigrams of rimes, word-final rimes, and segment -final rimes can discriminate the texts from different authors effectively when using random forests to establish the classification model. This robust approach can in principle be applied to other languages with established phonological inventory of onset and rimes.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Bigram', 'Lexicalization', 'Speech recognition', 'Trigram']","['Renkui Hou', 'Chu‐Ren Huang']",85,False,Natural Language Engineering,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

The first approach is related to Benford’s Law and the analysis of the frequency distribution of various leading digits of numerals contained in the text. In coherent literary texts, the share of the leading digit 1 is even larger than prescribed by Benford’s Law and can reach 50 percent. The frequencies of occurrence of the digit 1, as well as, to a lesser extent, the digits 2 and 3, are usually a characteristic the author’s style feature, manifested in all (sufficiently long) literary texts of any author. This approach is convenient for testing whether a group of texts has common authorship: the latter is dubious if the frequency distributions are sufficiently different. The second approach is the extension of the first one and requires the study of the frequency distribution of numerals themselves (not their leading digits). The approach yields non-trivial information about the author, stylistic and genre peculiarities of the texts and is suited for the advanced stylometric analysis.

It is useful to find out the author with a given set of text based on author writing style. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Various methods that include Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) have been used to find text patterns that exist within a text based database. The classification of the text patterns is deterministic whereas the authorship attribution to the text is un-deterministic. This paper presents a method that recognize a text pattern by using the authorship features using different phases of processing which include prior processing, extracting the features, feature selection, classifying the features and then finally leading to finding the author. Findings: The task of Authorship Attribution can be imposed to a range of exercises such as Scientific Analysis, Stealing Recognition and Authorship Recognition. Exploration in the part of Authorship Attribution is in view for more than 100 centuries, but the completed consequences were unacceptable. A range of provocations have been referred which include information collections, tokenizing of the content, applying Natural Language Tools, suitability of categorization methods and reorganization of a range of appearance which can discriminate one writer from the other writers. From the prevailing analysis, it can be concluded that the pronounced accruement are individual circumstance scene of situations, since it may not be useful to other consequences of Authorship Attribution associations.

Authorship Attribution for a Resource Poor Language—Urdu,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3487061,10,"Authorship attribution refers to examining the writing style of authors to determine the likelihood of the original author of a document from a given set of potential authors. Due to the wide range of authorship attribution applications, a plethora of studies have been conducted for various Western, as well as Asian, languages. However, authorship attribution research in the Urdu language has just begun, although Urdu is widely acknowledged as a prominent South Asian language. Furthermore, the existing studies on authorship attribution in Urdu have addressed a considerably easier problem of having less than 20 candidate authors, which is far from the real-world settings. Therefore, the findings from these studies may not be applicable to the real-world settings. To that end, we have made three key contributions: First, we have developed a large authorship attribution corpus for Urdu, which is a low-resource language. The corpus is composed of over 2.6 million tokens and 21,938 news articles by 94 authors, which makes it a closer substitute to the real-world settings. Second, we have analyzed hundreds of stylometry features used in the literature to identify 194 features that are applicable to the Urdu language and developed a taxonomy of these features. Finally, we have performed 66 experiments using two heterogeneous datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of four traditional and three deep learning techniques. The experimental results show the following: (a) Our developed corpus is many folds larger than the existing corpora, and it is more challenging than its counterparts for the authorship attribution task, and (b) Convolutional Neutral Networks is the most effective technique, as it achieved a nearly perfect F1 score of 0.989 for an existing corpus and 0.910 for our newly developed corpus.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Urdu', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Resource (disambiguation)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Taxonomy (biology)', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Computer network', 'Philosophy', 'Botany', 'Biology', 'Programming language', 'Archaeology']","['Zulqarnain Nazir', 'Khurram Shahzad', 'Muhammad Kamran Malik', 'Waheed Anwar', 'Imran Sarwar Bajwa', 'Khawar Mehmood']",44,False,ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Zeta, a test widely used in computational stylistics, is described by Gabriel Egan as ‘by some way the most powerful general-purpose authorship tool currently available’. This article offers extensive independent testing of Zeta. Following criticism of the existing method of Zeta analysis, this article introduces a new, statistically sound method for analysing Zeta results. It investigates a claim that the test is 99.9% reliable in differentiating Shakespeare’s style from Marlowe’s. Examining the conditions under which certain authors were ruled in or out of co-authorship of the Henry VI plays, it determines the effect of disparity in data set size on Zeta’s reliability, as well the effect of small data sets. Several test results confirm that Zeta is unduly influenced by genre. The article concludes that in the light of this study, the small canons of most Early Modern dramatists, particularly where they are genre-skewed like Marlowe’s, do not provide enough data for Zeta to be reliable","['Stylometry', 'Criticism', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Variance (accounting)', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics education', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Paleontology', 'Power (physics)', 'Accounting', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Business']",['R.

A statistical analysis of different articles by different writers was created that can identify the real author. An artificial neural network model was developed to identify a writer from an unknown document and it achieved above 85% accuracy rate for each writer.

This study demonstrates how widely available Universal Dependency parsers can generate useful morphological and syntactic data for texts in a range of languages. These data can serve as the basis for input features that are strongly informative about the style of individual novels, as indicated by accuracy in classification tests.

Detection of Online Contract Cheating Through Stylometry: A Pilot Study,2020,https://doi.org/10.24059/olj.v24i2.2096,37,"Contract cheating, instances in which a student enlists someone other than themselves to produce coursework, has been identified as a growing problem within academic integrity literature and in news headlines. The percentage of students who have utilized this type of cheating has been reported to range between 6% and 15.7%. Generational sentiments about cheating and the prevalent accessibility of contract cheating providers online seems to only have exacerbated the issue. The problem is that there is currently no simple means identified and verified to detect contract cheating, as available plagiarism detection software has been shown to be ineffective in these cases. One method that is commonly used for authorship authentication in nonacademic settings, stylometry, has been suggested as a potential means for detection. Stylometry uses various attributes of documents to determine if they were written by the same individual. This pilot study sought to assess the utility of three easy to use and readily available stylometry software systems to detect simulated cases of contract cheating on academic documents. Average accuracy ranged from 33% to 88.9%. While more research is necessary to further investigate the reliability of the best performing software packages, stylometry software appears to show significant promise for the potential detection of contract cheating.","['Cheating', 'Stylometry', 'Coursework', 'Academic integrity', 'Plagiarism detection', 'Computer science', 'Software', 'Malware', 'Academic dishonesty', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics education', 'Programming language']",['David Ison'],29,True,Online Learning,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

Stylometry Based Authorship Identification,2018,https://doi.org/10.22214/ijraset.2018.4640,0,"Every person is unique"", we have been hearing this since ages.Every person has a unique identity, a unique fingerprint, a unique retina and a lot more.These features play a vital role in identification of individuals for security purposes.Unfortunately, when it comes to security of written pieces or words from an individual, these primary unique identities are futile. One cannot identify a writer from a written piece of text on the basis of retina or fingerprint scans, sometimes even the signature can be forged, in such situations for security purposes and intellectual property rights it becomes very important to identify the true author. Stylometry plays an important role in this. Every author has a unique style of writing, measure of this style of writing is called Stylometry. This paper proposes to identify authors from text based on their style of writing. First a data set consisting of articles, short stories and emails will be used to train the system for multiple authors, then a random text would be given to the system to identify the author correctly, if the author predicted by the system is similar to the author claimed then the information is authentic otherwise the author claiming to be the writer is a fraud. For stylometry, over the ages, many features have been focused on, but this paper proposes new features to be used for this purpose. While writing, there are many unconscious styles that are incorporated by the author, these features have been unnoticed till date, but can play a vital role in accurate and fast identification of authors.

De‐anonymizing Ethereum blockchain smart contracts through code attribution,2020,https://doi.org/10.1002/nem.2130,22,"Summary Blockchain users are identified by addresses (public keys), which cannot be easily linked back to them without out‐of‐network information. This provides pseudo‐anonymity, which is amplified when the user generates a new address for each transaction. Since all transaction history is visible to all users in public blockchains, finding affiliation between related addresses undermines pseudo‐anonymity. Such affiliation information can be used to discriminate against addresses linked with undesired activities or can lead to de‐anonymization if out‐of‐network information becomes available. In this work, we propose an approach to undermine pseudo‐anonymity of blockchain transactions by linking together addresses that were used to deploy smart contracts, which were produced by the same authors. In our approach, we leverage stylometry techniques, widely used in the social science field for attribution of literary texts to their corresponding authors. The assumption underlying authorship attribution is the existence of a distinctive writing style, unique to an author and easily distinguishable from others. Drawing an analogy between literary text and smart contracts' source code, we explore the extent to which unique features of source code and byte code of Ethereum smart contracts can represent the coding style of smart contract developers. We show that even a small number of representative features leads to a sufficiently high accuracy in attributing smart contracts' code to its deployer's address. We further validate our approach on real‐world scammers' data and Ponzi scheme‐related contracts.

Stylometric analysis of French plays of the 17th century,2024,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqae011,0,"Abstract The automatic assignment of a text to one or more predefined categories presents multiple applications. In this context, the current study focuses on author attribution in which the true author of a doubtful text must be identified. This analysis focuses on the style of sixty-six French comedies in verse written by seventeen supposed authors during the 17th century. The hypothesis we want to verify assumes that the real author is the name appearing on the cover (called the signature hypothesis). In order to validate the reliability of two attribution procedures, we used two additional corpora based on 200 extracts of novels written in French, with thirty authors and 140 Italian novels authored by forty persons.

Code stylometry vs formatting and minification,2024,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2142,0,"The automatic identification of code authors based on their programming styles—known as authorship attribution or code stylometry—has become possible in recent years thanks to improvements in machine learning-based techniques for author recognition. Once feasible at scale, code stylometry can be used for well-intended or malevolent activities, including: identifying the most expert coworker on a piece of code (if authorship information goes missing); fingerprinting open source developers to pitch them unsolicited job offers; de-anonymizing developers of illegal software to pursue them. Depending on their respective goals, stakeholders have an interest in making code stylometry either more or less effective. To inform these decisions we investigate how the accuracy of code stylometry is impacted by two common software development activities: code formatting and code minification. We perform code stylometry on Python code from the Google Code Jam dataset (59 authors) using a code2vec-based author classifier on concrete syntax tree (CST) representations of input source files. We conduct the experiment using both CSTs and ASTs (abstract syntax trees). We compare the respective classification accuracies on: (1) the original dataset, (2) the dataset formatted with Black, and (3) the dataset minified with Python Minifier. Our results show that: (1) CST-based stylometry performs better than AST-based (51.00%→68%), (2) code formatting makes a significant dent (15%) in code stylometry accuracy (68%→53%), with minification subtracting a further 3% (68%→50%). While the accuracy reduction is significant for both code formatting and minification, neither is enough to make developers non-recognizable via code stylometry.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Python (programming language)', 'Disk formatting', 'Source code', 'Code (set theory)', 'Software', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Programming language', 'Operating system', 'Set (abstract data type)']","['Stefano Balla', 'Maurizio Gabbrielli', 'Stefano Zacchiroli']",35,True,PeerJ Computer Science,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
"Blogs, Twitter Feeds, and Reddit Comments: Cross-domain Authorship Attribution",2016,https://doi.org/10.1515/popets-2016-0021,57,"Abstract Stylometry is a form of authorship attribution that relies on the linguistic information to attribute documents of unknown authorship based on the writing styles of a suspect set of authors. This paper focuses on the cross-domain subproblem where the known and suspect documents differ in the setting in which they were created. Three distinct domains, Twitter feeds, blog entries, and Reddit comments, are explored in this work. We determine that state-of-the-art methods in stylometry do not perform as well in cross-domain situations (34.3% accuracy) as they do in in-domain situations (83.5% accuracy) and propose methods that improve performance in the cross-domain setting with both feature and classification level techniques which can increase accuracy to up to 70%. In addition to testing these approaches on a large real world dataset, we also examine real world adversarial cases where an author is actively attempting to hide their identity. Being able to identify authors across domains facilitates linking identities across the Internet making this a key security and privacy concern; users can take other measures to ensure their anonymity, but due to their unique writing style, they may not be as anonymous as they believe.","['Stylometry', 'Suspect', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Domain (mathematical analysis)', 'Anonymity', 'Adversarial system', 'Attribution', 'Social media', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'The Internet', 'Identity (music)', 'Writing style', 'Data science', 'Key (lock)', 'Information retrieval', 'Internet privacy', 'World Wide Web', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Criminology', 'Acoustics', 'Programming language']","['Rebekah Overdorf', 'Rachel Greenstadt']",29,True,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Statistics of Numerals in Authorial Texts and Stylometry,2020,https://doi.org/10.20431/2347-3142.0805003,1,"Two approaches to the statistical analysis of texts are suggested, both based on the study of numerals occurring in coherent literary texts.The first approach is related to the study of the frequency distribution of various leading digits of numerals occurring in the text.These frequencies are unequal: the digit 1 is strongly dominating; usually, the incidence of subsequent digits is monotonically decreasing.The frequencies of occurrence of the digit 1, as well as, to a lesser extent, the digits 2 and 3, are usually a characteristic author's style feature, manifested in all (sufficiently long) literary texts of any author.This approach is convenient for testing whether a group of texts has common authorship: the latter is dubious if the frequency distributions are sufficiently different.The second approach is the extension of the first one and requires the study of the frequency distribution of numerals themselves (not their leading digits).The approach yields non-trivial information about the author, stylistic and genre peculiarities of the texts and is suited for the advanced discourse analysis.A.

Evaluating Author Attribution on Emirati Tweets,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3016731,2,"Author Attribution (AA) is a critical stylometry problem that tries to deduce the identity of the authors of electronic texts (e-texts) by only examining the texts. AA is essential for enhancing various application domains, such as recommender systems and forensics. Nevertheless, existing techniques in AA have not been assessed with Emirati social media e-texts. The reason is that no suitable dataset exists for evaluating AA techniques in this context.

From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to Hildegard is fascinating. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language of which she did not master all grammatical subtleties. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. Especially Hildegard's last collaborator, Guibert of Gembloux, seems to have considerably reworked her works during his secretaryship. Whereas her other scribes were only allowed to make superficial linguistic changes, Hildegard would have permitted Guibert to render her language stylistically more elegant. In this article, we focus on two shorter texts: the Visio ad Guibertum missa and Visio de Sancto Martino, both of which Hildegard allegedly authored during Guibert's secretaryship. We analyze a corpus containing the letter collections of Hildegard, Guibert, and Bernard of Clairvaux using a number of common stylometric techniques. We discuss our results in the light of the Synergy Hypothesis, suggesting that texts resulting from collaboration can display a style markedly different from that of the collaborating authors.

Text Classification for Authorship Attribution Using Naive Bayes Classifier with Limited Training Data,2014,,38,"Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying authors of disputed or anonymous texts. It can be seen as a single, multi-class text classification task. It is concerned with writing style rather than topic matter. The scalability issue in traditional AA studies concerns the effect of data size, the amount of data per candidate author. This has not been probed in much depth yet, since most stylometry researches tend to focus on long texts per author or multiple short texts, because stylistic choices frequently occur less in such short texts. This paper investigates the task of authorship attribution on short historical Arabic texts written by10 different authors. Several experiments are conducted on these texts by extracting various lexical and character features of the writing style of each author, using N-grams word level (1,2,3, and 4) and character level (1,2,3, and 4) grams as a text representation. Then Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is employed in order to classify the texts to their authors. This is to show robustness of NB classifier in doing AA on very short-sized texts when compared to Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using dataset (called AAAT) which consists of 3 short texts per author’s book, it is shown our method is at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) for the selection of the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the significance of punctuation marks is explored in order to distinguish between authors, showing that an increase in the performance can be achieved. As well, the NB classifier achieved high accuracy results. Since the experiments of AA task that are done on AAAT dataset show interesting results with a classification accuracy of the best score obtained up to 96% using N-gram word level 1gram.

Adversarial Authorship Attribution for Deobfuscation,2022,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.509,3,"Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled powerful privacy-invasive authorship attribution. To counter authorship attribution, researchers have proposed a variety of rule-based and learning-based text obfuscation approaches. However, existing authorship obfuscation approaches do not consider the adversarial threat model. Specifically, they are not evaluated against adversarially trained authorship attributors that are aware of potential obfuscation. To fill this gap, we investigate the problem of adversarial authorship attribution for deobfuscation. We show that adversarially trained authorship attributors are able to degrade the effectiveness of existing obfuscators from 20-30% to 5-10%. We also evaluate the effectiveness of adversarial training when the attributor makes incorrect assumptions about whether and which obfuscator was used. While there is a a clear degradation in attribution accuracy, it is noteworthy that this degradation is still at or above the attribution accuracy of the attributor that is not adversarially trained at all.

An Optimal Feature Set for Stylometry-based Style Change detection at Document and Sentence Level,2022,https://doi.org/10.32628/cseit228617,1,"Writing style change detection models focus on determining the number of authors of documents with or without known authors. Determining the exact number of authors contributing in writing a document particularly when the authors contribute short texts in form of a sentence is still challenging because of the lack of standardized feature sets able to discriminate between the works of authors. Therefore, the task of identifying the best feature set for all the tasks of the writing style change detection is still considered important. This paper sought to determine the best feature set for the writing style change detection tasks; separating documents with several style changes (multi-authorship) from documents without any style changes (single-authorship), and determining the number and location of style changes in the case of multi-authorship. We performed exploratory research on existing stylometric features to determine the best document level and sentence level features. Document level features were extracted and used to separate single authored from multi-authored documents, while sentence level features were used to answer the question of determining the number of style changes To answer this question, we trained a random forest classifier to rank document level features and sentence level features separately, and applied an ablation test on the top 15 sentence level features using k-means clustering algorithm to confirm the effect of these features on model performance. The study found out that the best document level feature set for separating documents with and without style change was provided by an ensemble of features including number of sentence repetitions (num_sentence_repetitions) as the most determinant feature, 5-grams, 4-grams, Special_character, sentence_begin_lower, sentence_begin_upper, diversity, automated_readability_index, parenthesis_count, first_word_uppercase, lensear_write_formula, dale_chall_readability, difficult_words, type_token_ratio","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Sentence', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Writing style', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Programming language']","['Vivian Anyango Oloo', 'Lilian Wanzare', 'Calvins Otieno']",24,True,International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Authorship attribution for textual data on online social networks,2017,https://doi.org/10.1109/ic3.2017.8284311,8,"Authorship Attribution, (AA) is a process of determining a particular document is written by which author among a list of suspected authors. Authorship attribution has been the problem from last six decades; when there were handwritten documents needed to be identified for the genuine author. Due to the technology advancement and increase in cybercrime and unlawful activities, this problem of AA becomes forth most important to trace out the author behind online messages. Over the past, many years research has been conducted to attribute the authorship of an author on the basis of their writing style as all authors possess different distinctiveness while writing a piece of document. This paper presents a comparative study of various machine learning approaches on different feature sets for authorship attribution on short text. The Twitter dataset has been used for comparison with varying sample size of a dataset of 10 prolific authors with various combinations of feature sets. The significance and impact of combinations of features while inferring different stylometric features has been reflected. The results of different approaches are compared based on their accuracy and precision values.","['Authorship attribution', 'Optimal distinctiveness theory', 'Computer science', 'TRACE (psycholinguistics)', 'Attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Information retrieval', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Writing style', 'Process (computing)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Sample (material)', 'Natural language processing', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Chemistry', 'Archaeology', 'Chromatography', 'Psychotherapist', 'History', 'Operating system']","['Ritu Banga', 'Pulkit Mehndiratta']",23,False,,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
A Complex Network Approach to Stylometry,2015,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136076,78,"Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.","['Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Complement (music)', 'Complex system', 'Complex network', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language', 'Machine learning', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Topology (electrical circuits)', 'Mathematics', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Combinatorics', 'Complementation', 'World Wide Web', 'Gene', 'Phenotype']",['Diego R.

An interesting fact is that a number of cases were found with evidence that points to the falsification of texts and someone's authorship. Proofing authorship dispute cases in Indonesia has not reached an analysis of authorship, because of the difficulty of identifying personal identity in electronic texts, especially in short texts with limited characters and words. This study examines Indonesian text set to investigate and describe linguistic profiles based on N-gram analysis and style characteristics. The data source in this study is Corpora of electronic text sets from 50 unique authors, including 8 authors and evidence from criminal cases, which are limited to 2000 characters or 500 words. All texts are personal texts that are collected from volunteers and case documents that are permitted to be accessed. Data analysis was carried out by determining and calculating the n-grams, both on the character-level and word-level, and performing stylometric features that the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library extracts. The results of the data analysis show that lexically, the character-level n-gram analysis, as the smallest n-unit, shows an important element of authorship attribution, such as the use of alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, capitalization, and punctuation. Diction is a significant factor to identify the author's profile and distinguish between one author and another.

Investigating the Linguistic Fingerprint of GPT-4o in Arabic-to-English Translation Using Stylometry,2024,https://doi.org/10.48185/jtls.v5i3.1343,0,"This study explores the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of machine-generated texts, focusing on the output of GPT-4o. Using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including word frequency and stopword count analysis, readability and sentence structure metrics, lexical diversity measures, syntactic frequency analysis, and named entity recognition (NER), the research aims to uncover the stylometric fingerprints present in machine-generated content. The results reveal that GPT-4ogenerated texts exhibit moderate lexical diversity and syntactic complexity, with certain chapters reflecting higher readability and more varied sentence structures, while others lean toward simpler linguistic patterns. The findings also highlight thematic variation across chapters, as observed in the distribution of named entities, which contributes to understanding the model’s handling of different contextual content. The research suggests that while GPT-4o maintains a consistent style in its generated text, there are distinguishable characteristics that may serve as indicators of machine authorship. This provides valuable insights for stylometric analysis, authorship attribution, and the identification of machine-generated texts in various contexts. Future research could extend this work by exploring deeper stylometric features, conducting cross-model comparisons, and developing advanced authorship detection algorithms tailored for AI-generated content.

Inspired by the success of modern automatic document classification problem, some researchers followed the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) approach for authenticating long documents. In this work, we consider both approaches and their application on authenticating tweets, which represent additional challenges due to the limitation in their sizes. We focus on the Arabic language due to its importance and the scarcity of works related on it.

E-mail authorship attribution using customized associative classification,2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2015.05.012,36,"E-mail communication is often abused for conducting social engineering attacks including spamming, phishing, identity theft and for distributing malware.

The developed model is employed to identify the most plausible writer of the text. Unfortunately, most existing studies focus solely on improving predictive accuracy and not on the inherent value of the evidence collected. In this study, we propose a customized associative classification technique, a popular data mining method, to address the authorship attribution problem.

Stylometric Anonymity: Is Imitation the Best Strategy?,2015,https://doi.org/10.1109/trustcom.2015.472,1,"Stylometry analysis of given electronic texts can allow for the extraction of information about their authors by analyzing the stylistic choices the authors make to write their texts. Such extracted information could be the identity of suspect authors or their profile attributes such as their gender, age group, ethnicity group, etc. Therefore, when preserving the anonymity of an author is critical, such as that of a whistle blower, it is important to ensure the stylistic anonymity of the conveyed text itself in addition to anonymizing communication channels (e.g. Tor, or the minimization of application fingerprints). Currently, only two stylistic anonymization strategies are known, namely: imitation and obfuscation attacks. A long-term objective is to find automated methods that reliably transform given input texts such that the output texts maximize author anonymity while, reasonably, preserving the semantics of the input texts. Before one proceeds with such long-term objective, it is important to first identify effective strategies that maximize stylistic anonymity. The current state of the literature implies that imitation attacks are better at preserving the anonymity of authors than obfuscation. However, we argue that such evaluations are limited and should not generalize to stylistic anonymity as they were only executed against AA solvers, a closed-set problem. In this study, we extend such evaluations against state-of-the-art AV solvers, an open-set problem. Our results show that imitation attacks degrade the classification accuracy of AV solvers more aggressively than that of AA solvers. We argue that such reduction in accuracy below random chance guessing renders imitation attacks as inferior strategies relative to obfuscation attacks. Furthermore, as we present a general formal notation of stylometry problems, we conjecture that the same observations apply to all stylometry problems (AA, AV, AP, SI).","['Anonymity', 'Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Obfuscation', 'Imitation', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Suspect', 'Identity (music)', 'Term (time)', 'State (computer science)', 'Scheme (mathematics)', 'Computer security', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Algorithm', 'Mathematics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Political science', 'Acoustics', 'Law', 'Programming language']","['Mahmoud Khonji', 'Youssef Iraqi']",14,False,2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667

This article applies stylometry, the computational method of analysing style, to the oeuvres of 10 Dutch and English crosswriters to trace potential differences in their individual style and similarities between the authors. The analyses also take into account the age of the intended reader (as listed in the paratext) and the publication date, to study the influence these aspects have on writing style. Four case studies zoom in on a specific author or age category of the intended readership to study general tendencies as well as outliers. The results from the stylometric analyses are complemented with peritextual information about the author’s view on style and writing for readerships of different ages. The main conclusion drawn from the case studies is that the style of the texts usually correlates more strongly with the age of the intended reader than with the time period in which it was written. Young adult literature clusters more closely with adult literature.

Stylometry for Medieval Authorship Studies: An Application to Rhyme Words,2012,https://doi.org/10.1353/dph.2012.0002,13,"In the digital humanities much research has been done concerning stylometry, the computational study of style. Literary authorship at-tribution, especially, has been a central topic. After a brief introduction, I will discuss the enormous potential of this paradigm for medieval philology, a field that studies so many texts of unknown or disputed origin. At the same time, it will be stressed that stylometry’s application to medieval texts is currently not without problems: many attribution techniques are still controversial and do not account for the specific nature of medieval text production. Throughout this paper, I will tentatively apply two well-established attribution techniques (principal components analysis and Burrows’s Delta) to a number of case studies in Middle Dutch studies. These analyses shall be restricted to rhyme words, since these words are less likely to have been altered by scribes.","['Stylometry', 'Rhyme', 'Authorship attribution', 'Philology', 'Literature', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Linguistics', 'History', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Poetry', 'Gender studies']",['Mike Kestemont'],37,False,Digital philology,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Method of Textual Information Authorship Analysis Based on Stylometry,2018,https://doi.org/10.1109/stc-csit.2018.8526608,21,The paper dwells on the peculiarities of stylometry technologies usage to determine the style of the author publications. Statistical linguistic analysis of the author's text allows taking advantage of text content monitoring based on Porter stemmer and NLP methods to determine the set of stop words. The latter is used in the methods of stylometry to determine the ownership of the analyzed text to a specific author in percentage points. There is proposed a formal approach to the definition of the author's style of the Ukrainian text in the article. The experimental results of the proposed method for determining the ownership of the analyzed text to a particular author upon the availability of the reference text fragment are obtained. The study was conducted on the basis of the Ukrainian scientific texts of a technical area.,"['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Ukrainian', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Natural language processing', 'Writing style', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Programming language']","['Victoria Vysotska', 'Vasyl Lytvyn', 'Mariya Hrendus', 'Solomiya Kubinska', 'Oksana Brodyak']",51,False,2018 IEEE 13th International Scientific and Technical Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies (CSIT),[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Philological Studies: Computer Aspects of Stylometry Automation,2024,https://doi.org/10.47526/2024-3/2664-0686.72,0,"The article aims at considering stylometry automation of philological studies. The relevance of this article stems from the need to trace and critically analyze the results of numerous studies in the interdisciplinary field that have been actively developed in recent years to identify the author of the text using artificial intelligence methods (authorship attribution and profiling) as well as to provide theoretical foundations and a comprehensive stylometric methodology (i.e. based on the analysis of quantifiable linguistic features using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms) to identify the author of the text, based on the principles of explanation, objectivity, evidence, and open science. Within the framework of subject and activity identification idiolectology - is a developing scientific direction that focuses specifically on the systematic study of the phenomenon of idiolect in the identification of computer aspects using modern achievements of computational and corpus linguistics, and data science. The authors of the article claim that the task of computational and corpus linguistics is to provide the researcher with all the necessary material, to prepare the data for counting, and to offer a wide range of computational procedures that can be used to test hypotheses, together to confirm or refute ever subtler and profound philological observations. Philological problems, in solution of which language information is used, usually have, a clear application, orientation, the language, and style of the text in such a situation are not the goal of the study, but a means of solving extra-linguistic problems. The solution of a specific philological problem (e.g., the problem of disputed authorship) is usually not limited to the rigid framework of a particular research methodology but is carried out using methods and facts in various fields of knowledge and practical activities.","['Stylometry', 'Philology', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Feminism', 'Sociology', 'Gender studies']","['R.Zh.

Computational methods in authorship attribution,2008,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20961,472,"Abstract Statistical authorship attribution has a long history, culminating in the use of modern machine learning classification methods. Nevertheless, most of this work suffers from the limitation of assuming a small closed set of candidate authors and essentially unlimited training text for each. Real‐life authorship attribution problems, however, typically fall short of this ideal. Thus, following detailed discussion of previous work, three scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first variant, the profiling problem, there is no candidate set at all; in this case, the challenge is to provide as much demographic or psychological information as possible about the author. In the second variant, the needle‐in‐a‐haystack problem, there are many thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample. In the third variant, the verification problem, there is no closed candidate set but there is one suspect; in this case, the challenge is to determine if the suspect is or is not the author. For each variant, it is shown how machine learning methods can be adapted to handle the special challenges of that variant.","['Haystack', 'Suspect', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Profiling (computer programming)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Criminology', 'Programming language', 'Operating system']","['Moshe Koppel', 'Jonathan Schler', 'Shlomo Argamon']",114,True,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,[],2,6.71366230276956e-06,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8666666666666667
Stylometry and characterisation in &lt;i&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/i&gt;,2016,https://doi.org/10.4102/lit.v37i2.1282,21,"Dialogue is an important aspect of televisual character construction. Writers make linguistic choices on behalf of characters, and these choices can cause viewers to associate a character with a specific stereotype, subculture or social group. This study examines the linguistic construction of the character Sheldon Cooper in the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory. A cluster analysis tree of the speech of each of the five main characters in the first seven seasons (generated by the R script Stylo 0.6.0) indicated that the character of Sheldon Cooper differs from the other main characters (Leonard, Penny, Howard and Rajesh) with respect to linguistic style. These differences were further explored using corpus analysis software (WordSmith 6.0) to identify keywords and lexical bundles and to compare the use of active versus passive voice constructions. Sheldon’s choice of scientific or more formal words and his relative preference for the passive voice typify his linguistic style as expository rather than colloquial.","['Character (mathematics)', 'Stylometry', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Linguistics', 'Stereotype (UML)', 'Preference', 'Passive voice', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Social psychology', 'Statistics', 'Geometry']","['M.
