Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries,2018,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21492,76017,"Abstract This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2%), stomach cancer (8.2%), and liver cancer (8.2%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high‐quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence‐based cancer control programs, are not available in most low‐ and middle‐income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

Gender Attribution: Tracing Stylometric Evidence Beyond Topic and Genre,2011,,106,"Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973)) postulate that women's language styles differ from that of men. In this paper, we explore statistical techniques that can learn to identify the gender of authors in modern English text, such as web blogs and scientific papers. Although recent work has shown the efficacy of statistical approaches to gender attribution, we conjecture that the reported performance might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic factors such as topic bias in gender that can make the gender detection task easier. Our work is the first that consciously avoids gender bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evidence to gender-specific styles in language beyond topic. In addition, our comparative study provides new insights into robustness of various stylometric techniques across topic and genre.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Gender bias', 'Robustness (evolution)', 'Tracing', 'Task (project management)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Gene', 'Operating system']","['Ruchita Sarawgi', 'Kailash Gajulapalli', 'Yejin Choi']",21,False,Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,[],3,93.26720375965088,0.001394424931265375,1.0,0.30097609745188575

"Robert Musil, a war journal, and stylometry: Tackling the issue of short texts in authorship attribution",2018,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy055,20,"Abstract During World War I (WWI), between 1916 and 1917, Robert Musil was the chief editor of the Tiroler Soldaten-Zeitung in Bozen. This activity probably also involved authorship of articles and has posed a philological problem to scholars, who have not been able to attribute with certainty a range of relatively short texts to Musil. With this article, we present a new approach that combines philological research with stylometric methods. Exploration of WWI archives and digitization of historical documents were paired with application of authorship attribution techniques, following extensive evaluation. To build the training set, we adapted the ‘impostors method’ by grouping three ‘distractor authors’ (similar to Musil in terms of style) and three actual candidates for authorship. In the test set, we developed two designs for tackling the issue of text length: a combinatory design, where longer chunks were composed by the juxtaposition of short texts; a simplified design, where the texts for attribution were merged with already attributed texts. Results of our experiment suggest that Musil attribution may be disproved with a high level of confidence for ten texts that were more probably written by a less well-known author, Albert Ritter. We carried out a keyness analysis on the specific words preferred or avoided by the two authors, which not only corroborated the results of the quantitative analysis but also findings from Musil philology. Our study showcases the potentialities of using mixed methods in stylometry.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Philology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Certainty', 'Computer science', 'Literature', 'History', 'Art', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Feminism', 'Social psychology', 'Programming language']","['Simone Rebora', 'J.

The Effectiveness of Stemming in the Stylometric Authorship Attribution in Arabic,2020,https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2020.0110114,20,"The recent years have witnessed the development of numerous approaches to authorship attribution including statistical and linguistic methods. Stylometric authorship attribution, however, remains among the most widely used due to its accuracy and effectiveness. Nevertheless, many authorship problems remain unresolved in terms of Arabic. This can be attributed to different factors including linguistic peculiarities that are not usually considered in standard authorship systems. In the case of Arabic, the morphological features carry unique stylistic features that can be usefully used in testing authorship in controversial texts and writings. The hypothesis is that much of these morphological features are lost due to the execution of stemming. As such, this study is concerned with investigating the effectiveness of stemming in the stylometric applications to authorship attribution in Arabic. In so doing, three Arabic stemmers GOLD stemmer, Khoga stemmer, Light 10 stemmer are used. By way of illustration, a corpus of 2400 news articles written by different 97 authors is designed. To evaluate the effectiveness of stemming, the selected articles (both stemmed and unstemmed texts) are clustered using cluster analysis methods. Comparisons are made between clustering structures based on stemmed and unstemmed datasets. The results indicate that stemming has negative impacts on the accuracy of the clustering performance and thus on the reliability of stylometric authorship testing in Arabic. The peculiar stylistic features of the affixation processes in Arabic can, thus, be usefully used for improving the performance of authorship attribution applications in Arabic. It can be finally concluded that stemming is not effective in the stylometric authorship applications in Arabic.","['Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Natural language processing', 'Arabic', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Cluster analysis', 'Attribution', 'Linguistics', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Social psychology']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Wafya Ibrahim']",33,True,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,[],3,70.51090970124203,0.00026309904363497637,1.0,0.3001841693305445
$CAG$ : Stylometric Authorship Attribution of Multi-Author Documents Using a Co-Authorship Graph,2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.2967449,19,"Stylometry has been successfully applied to perform authorship identification of single-author documents (AISD). The AISD task is concerned with identifying the original author of an anonymous document from a group of candidate authors. However, AISD techniques are not applicable to the authorship identification of multi-author documents (AIMD). Unlike AISD, where each document is written by one single author, AIMD focuses on handling multi-author documents. Due to the combinatoric nature of documents, AIMD lacks the ground truth information-that is, information on writing and non-writing authors in a multi-author document-which makes this problem more challenging to solve. Previous AIMD solutions have a number of limitations: (i) the best stylometry-based AIMD solution has a low accuracy, less than 30%; (ii) increasing the number of co-authors of papers adversely affects the performance of AIMD solutions; and (iii) AIMD solutions were not designed to handle the non-writing authors (NWAs). However, NWAs exist in real-world cases-that is, there are papers for which not every co-author listed has contributed as a writer. This paper proposes an AIMD framework called the Co-Authorship Graph that can be used to (i) capture the stylistic information of each author in a corpus of multi-author documents and (ii) make a multi-label prediction for a multi-author query document. We conducted extensive experimental studies on one synthetic and three real-world corpora. Experimental results show that our proposed framework (i) significantly outperformed competitive techniques; (ii) can effectively handle a larger number of co-authors in comparison with competitive techniques; and (iii) can effectively handle NWAs in multi-author documents.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Information retrieval', 'Identification (biology)', 'Task (project management)', 'Graph', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Botany', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Raheem Sarwar', 'Norawit Urailertprasert', 'Nattapol Vannaboot', 'Chenyun Yu', 'Thanawin Rakthanmanon', 'Ekapol Chuangsuwanich', 'Sarana Nutanong']",55,True,IEEE Access,['Thailand Research Fund'],3,69.6455186304129,0.0002499440914532276,1.0,0.30017496086401724

Dropping down the Maximum Item Set: Improving the Stylometric Authorship Attribution Algorithm in the Text Mining for Authorship Investigation,2010,https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2010.235.243,6,"Problem statement: Stylometric authorship attribution is an approach concerned about analyzing texts in text mining, e.g., novels and plays that famous authors wrote, trying to measure the authors style, by choosing some attributes that shows the author style of writing, assuming that these writers have a special way of writing that no other writer has; thus, authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. In this study, we propose an authorship attribution algorithm, improving the accuracy of Stylometric features of different professionals so it can be discriminated nearly as well as fingerprints of different persons using authorship attributes. Approach: The main target in this study is to build an algorithm supports a decision making systems enables users to predict and choose the right author for a specific anonymous author's novel under consideration, by using a learning procedure to teach the system the Stylometric map of the author and behave as an expert opinion. The Stylometric Authorship Attribution (AA) usually depends on the frequent word as the best attribute that could be used, many studies strived for other beneficiary attributes, still the frequent word is ahead of other attributes that gives better results in the researches and experiments and still the best parameter and technique that's been used till now is the counting of the bag-of-word with the maximum item set. Results: To improve the techniques of the AA, we need to use new pack of attributes with a new measurement tool, the first pack of attributes we are using in this study is the (frequent pair) which means a pair of words that always appear together, this attribute clearly is not a new one, but it wasn't a successive attribute compared with the frequent word, using the maximum item set counters. the words pair made some mistakes as we see in the experiment results, improving the winnow algorithm by combining it with the computational approach, achieved by us","['Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Stylometry', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Task (project management)', 'Statement (logic)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Information retrieval', 'Word (group theory)', 'Ranking (information retrieval)', 'Rank (graph theory)', 'Data mining', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'History', 'Programming language', 'Mathematics', 'Combinatorics']",['Mustafa'],9,True,Journal of Computer Science,[],3,51.676401477005705,7.892971309049292e-05,1.0,0.30005525079916334

Authorship attribution of Morsi Gameel Aziz’s lyrics: A clustering-based stylometry approach,2021,https://doi.org/10.52462/jlls.36,2,"Numerous studies have addressed the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics. These studies have traditionally been based on chronological criteria for determining the real authors of disputed lyrics. To date, there is no agreement on the real authors of these disputed lyrics. This can mainly be attributed to both selectivity and the lack of empirical evidence in such studies, raising questions about the reliability of such approaches. With the advent of machine learning systems and data mining techniques, it is now possible to process thousands of texts using replicable methods. Thus, this study seeks to address the issue of the authorship of Morsi Gameel Azizâ€™s lyrics making use of these advances by applying a clustering-based stylometry approach. The hypothesis is that lyrics grouped or clustered together are more likely to be written by the same poet. A corpus of 1,089 lyrics was built, including all known lyrics attributed to Aziz and the lyrics of the poets thought to be the real authors of the disputed lyrics. The lyrics were clustered using the Gibbs sampling Dirichlet multinomial mixture (GSDMM) technique, and were assigned to 4 main classes, with the 12 disputed lyrics clustered within Azizâ€™s class. Based on this, it is clear that the GSDMM model is effective and reliable in clustering short documents in Arabic.

This study indicates the robustness of KNN in performing AA on short historical Arabic texts written by different authors. To classify the texts according to the author, KNN was trained with a set of stylometry features including rare words, count characters and 2-, 3- and 4-grams character levels. Various feature set sizes ranging from 34 to 2000 were tested in the experiment. The experiments were conducted on limited training data with datasets consisting of 3 short texts per the author’s book. This method proved to be at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) when selecting the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the KNN classifier achieved high accuracy results with the best classification accuracy of up to 90%, except for the 5-KK using the 4-gram character level.

Computational methods in authorship attribution,2008,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20961,472,"Abstract Statistical authorship attribution has a long history, culminating in the use of modern machine learning classification methods. Nevertheless, most of this work suffers from the limitation of assuming a small closed set of candidate authors and essentially unlimited training text for each. Real‐life authorship attribution problems, however, typically fall short of this ideal. Thus, following detailed discussion of previous work, three scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first variant, the profiling problem, there is no candidate set at all; in this case, the challenge is to provide as much demographic or psychological information as possible about the author. In the second variant, the needle‐in‐a‐haystack problem, there are many thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample. In the third variant, the verification problem, there is no closed candidate set but there is one suspect; in this case, the challenge is to determine if the suspect is or is not the author. For each variant, it is shown how machine learning methods can be adapted to handle the special challenges of that variant.","['Haystack', 'Suspect', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Profiling (computer programming)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Criminology', 'Programming language', 'Operating system']","['Moshe Koppel', 'Jonathan Schler', 'Shlomo Argamon']",114,True,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,[],2,99.10238335011748,0.0062091374297854425,0.6666666666666666,0.2043463962008498

The Federalist Revisited: New Directions in Authorship Attribution,1995,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/10.2.111,274,"The Federalist Papers, twelve of which are claimed by both Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, have long been used as a testing-ground for authorship attribution techniques despite the fact that the styles of Hamilton and Madison are unusually similar. This paper assesses the value of three novel stylometric techniques by applying them to the Federalist problem. The techniques examined are a multivariate approach to vocabulary richness, analysis of the frequencies of occurrence of sets of common high-frequency words, and use of a machine-learning package based on a ‘genetic algorithm’ to seek relational expressions characterizing authorial styles. All three approaches produce encouraging results to what is acknowledged to be a difficult problem.","['Federalist', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Vocabulary', 'Value (mathematics)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Machine learning', 'Philosophy', 'Political science', 'Social psychology', 'Law', 'Politics']",['David I.

Adversarial stylometry,2012,https://doi.org/10.1145/2382448.2382450,183,"The use of stylometry, authorship recognition through purely linguistic means, has contributed to literary, historical, and criminal investigation breakthroughs. Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation , where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation , where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67% of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks. This article also contributes to the field by using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for four current techniques (without adversaries). We have also compiled and released two corpora of adversarial stylometry texts to promote research in this field with a total of 57 unique authors. We argue that this field is important to a multidisciplinary approach to privacy, security, and anonymity.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Adversarial system', 'Obfuscation', 'Subject (documents)', 'Anonymity', 'Writing style', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Computer security', 'World Wide Web', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics']","['Michael Brennan', 'Sadia Afroz', 'Rachel Greenstadt']",20,False,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security,"['Intel Corporation', 'Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency']",2,96.55320577374958,0.002407356249260034,0.6666666666666666,0.201685149374482
Neural Computation in Stylometry I: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Fletcher,1993,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/8.4.203,145,"We consider the stylometric uses of a pattern recognition technique inspired by neurological research known as neural computation.

De-anonymizing programmers via code stylometry,2015,,142,"Source code authorship attribution is a significant privacy threat to anonymous code contributors. However, it may also enable attribution of successful attacks from code left behind on an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft, and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. In this work, we investigate machine learning methods to de-anonymize source code authors of C/C++ using coding style. Our Code Stylometry Feature Set is a novel representation of coding style found in source code that reflects coding style from properties derived from abstract syntax trees.

Our random forest and abstract syntax tree-based approach attributes more authors (1,600 and 250) with significantly higher accuracy (94% and 98%) on a larger data set (Google Code Jam) than has been previously achieved. Furthermore, these novel features are robust, difficult to obfuscate, and can be used in other programming languages, such as Python. We also find that (i) the code resulting from difficult programming tasks is easier to attribute than easier tasks and (ii) skilled programmers (who can complete the more difficult tasks) are easier to attribute than less skilled programmers.","['Computer science', 'Programming language', 'Abstract syntax tree', 'Source code', 'Python (programming language)', 'Stylometry', 'Abstract syntax', 'Coding (social sciences)', 'Syntax', 'Code (set theory)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']","['Aylin Caliskan-Islam', 'Richard Harang', 'Andy Liu', 'Arvind Narayanan', 'Clare R.

The application of principal component analysis to stylometry,1999,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/14.4.445,140,"In recent years principal component analysis has become popular for investigations in computational stylistics, particularly for studies of authorship. The mathematical nature of the theory that underpins the method makes it rather inaccessible to linguists and literary scholars. Consequently, confidence in its correct application is diminished.

An experiment in authorship attribution,2002,,134,"This paper reports an experiment in authorship attribution that reveals considerable authorial structure in texts written by authors with very similar background and training, with genre and topic being strictly controlled for. We interpret our results as supporting the hypothesis that authors have ’ textual fingerprints’, at least for texts produced by authors who are not consciously changing their style of writing across texts. What this study has also taught us is that discriminant analysis is a more appropriate technique to use than principal components analysis when predicting the authorship of an unknown (held-out) text on the basis of known (training) texts of which the authorial provenance is available. Finally, standard discriminant analysis can be enhanced considerably by using an entropy-based weighting scheme of the kind used in latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998).","['Authorship attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Latent semantic analysis', 'Linear discriminant analysis', 'Stylometry', 'Weighting', 'Linguistics', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Medicine', 'Archaeology', 'Radiology']","['R.

A promising way of extending cluster analysis dendrograms with a self-validating procedure involves producing numerous particular 'snapshots', or dendrograms produced using different input parameters, and combining them all into the form of a consensus tree. Significantly better results, however, can be obtained using a new visualization technique, which combines the idea of nearest neighborhood derived from cluster analysis, the idea of hammering out a clustering consensus from bootstrap consensus trees, with the idea of mapping textual similarities onto a form of a network. Additionally, network analysis seems to be a good solution for large data sets.","['Stylometry', 'Visualization', 'Cluster analysis', 'Computer science', 'Hierarchical clustering', 'Data mining', 'Dendrogram', 'Cluster (spacecraft)', 'Network analysis', 'Tree (set theory)', 'Information visualization', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Mathematics', 'Engineering', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Population', 'Demography', 'Sociology', 'Genetic diversity', 'Programming language', 'Electrical engineering']",['Maciej Eder'],43,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,94.14467942262505,0.0015654393096281095,0.6666666666666666,0.20109580751673967
Authorship verification for short messages using stylometry,2013,https://doi.org/10.1109/cits.2013.6705711,102,"Authorship verification can be checked using stylometric techniques through the analysis of linguistic styles and writing characteristics of the authors. Stylometry is a behavioral feature that a person exhibits during writing and can be extracted and used potentially to check the identity of the author of online documents. Although stylometric techniques can achieve high accuracy rates for long documents, it is still challenging to identify an author for short documents, in particular when dealing with large authors populations. These hurdles must be addressed for stylometry to be usable in checking authorship of online messages such as emails, text messages, or twitter feeds. In this paper, we pose some steps toward achieving that goal by proposing a supervised learning technique combined with n-gram analysis for authorship verification in short texts. Experimental evaluation based on the Enron email dataset involving 87 authors yields very promising results consisting of an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 14.35% for message blocks of 500 characters.","['Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Writing style', 'USable', 'Natural language processing', 'Word error rate', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Information retrieval', 'Identity (music)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Authorship attribution', 'World Wide Web', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Acoustics']","['Marcelo Luiz Brocardo', 'Issa Traoré', 'Sherif Saad', 'Isaac Woungang']",23,False,,[],2,92.96878147029204,0.0013418051225383796,0.6666666666666666,0.20093926358577685
Doppelgänger Finder: Taking Stylometry to the Underground,2014,https://doi.org/10.1109/sp.2014.21,99,"Stylometry is a method for identifying anonymous authors of anonymous texts by analyzing their writing style. While stylometric methods have produced impressive results in previous experiments, we wanted to explore their performance on a challenging dataset of particular interest to the security research community. Analysis of underground forums can provide key information about who controls a given bot network or sells a service, and the size and scope of the cybercrime underworld. Previous analyses have been accomplished primarily through analysis of limited structured metadata and painstaking manual analysis. However, the key challenge is to automate this process, since this labor intensive manual approach clearly does not scale. We consider two scenarios. The first involves text written by an unknown cybercriminal and a set of potential suspects. This is standard, supervised stylometry problem made more difficult by multilingual forums that mix l33t-speak conversations with data dumps. In the second scenario, you want to feed a forum into an analysis engine and have it output possible doppelgangers, or users with multiple accounts. While other researchers have explored this problem, we propose a method that produces good results on actual separate accounts, as opposed to data sets created by artificially splitting authors into multiple identities. For scenario 1, we achieve 77% to 84% accuracy on private messages. For scenario 2, we achieve 94% recall with 90% precision on blogs and 85.18% precision with 82.14% recall for underground forum users.

Collaborative authorship in the twelfth century: A stylometric study of Hildegard of Bingen and Guibert of Gembloux,2013,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqt063,80,"Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) is one of the most influential female authors of the Middle Ages. From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to Hildegard is fascinating. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language of which she did not master all grammatical subtleties. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. Especially Hildegard's last collaborator, Guibert of Gembloux, seems to have considerably reworked her works during his secretaryship. Whereas her other scribes were only allowed to make superficial linguistic changes, Hildegard would have permitted Guibert to render her language stylistically more elegant. In this article, we focus on two shorter texts: the Visio ad Guibertum missa and Visio de Sancto Martino, both of which Hildegard allegedly authored during Guibert's secretaryship. We analyze a corpus containing the letter collections of Hildegard, Guibert, and Bernard of Clairvaux using a number of common stylometric techniques. We discuss our results in the light of the Synergy Hypothesis, suggesting that texts resulting from collaboration can display a style markedly different from that of the collaborating authors. Finally, we demonstrate that Guibert must have reworked the disputed visionary texts allegedly authored by Hildegard to such an extent that style-oriented computational procedures attribute the texts to Guibert.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Art', 'Literature', 'Stylometry', 'Art history', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy']","['Mike Kestemont', 'Stefaan Moens', 'Jeroen Deploige']",46,False,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,90.6847935548842,0.0010523961745399055,0.6666666666666666,0.20073667732217793
A Complex Network Approach to Stylometry,2015,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136076,78,"Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.","['Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Complement (music)', 'Complex system', 'Complex network', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language', 'Machine learning', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Topology (electrical circuits)', 'Mathematics', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Combinatorics', 'Complementation', 'World Wide Web', 'Gene', 'Phenotype']",['Diego R.

The best equal-error-rate performance on the keystroke system was 0.5% which is an improvement over earlier reported results on this system.

Style-markers in authorship attribution : a cross-language study of the authorial fingerprint,2011,,65,"The present study addresses one of the theoretical problems of computer-assisted authorship attribution, namely the question which traceable features of language can betray authorial uniqueness (a stylistic fingerprint) of literary texts. A number of recent approaches show that apart from lexical measures — especially those relying on the frequencies of the most frequent words — also some other features of written language are considerably effective as discriminators of authorial style. However, there have been no attempts to compare the attribution potential of these features. The aim of the present study, then, was to examine the effectiveness of several style-markers in authorship attribution. The style-markers chosen for the empirical investigation are those that can be retrieved from a non-lemmatized corpus of plain text files, such as the most frequent words, word bi-grams, different letter sequences, and markers of different nature, combined in one sample. Equally important, however, was to compare usefulness of the chosen style-markers across a few languages: English, Polish, German, and Latin. The results confirmed a high attribution effectiveness of word-based style-markers in the English corpus, but the alternative markers are shown to be usually more effective in the other languages.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'German', 'Linguistics', 'Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Writing style', 'Natural language processing', 'Fingerprint (computing)', 'Word (group theory)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy']",['Maciej Eder'],27,False,Studies in Polish Linguistics,[],2,88.4253105068815,0.0008550718918136733,0.6666666666666666,0.20059855032426954

Three distinct domains, Twitter feeds, blog entries, and Reddit comments, are explored in this work. We determine that state-of-the-art methods in stylometry do not perform as well in cross-domain situations (34.3% accuracy) as they do in in-domain situations (83.5% accuracy) and propose methods that improve performance in the cross-domain setting with both feature and classification level techniques which can increase accuracy to up to 70%. In addition to testing these approaches on a large real world dataset, we also examine real world adversarial cases where an author is actively attempting to hide their identity.

Conversationally-inspired stylometric features for authorship attribution in instant messaging,2012,https://doi.org/10.1145/2393347.2396398,51,"Authorship attribution (AA) aims at recognizing automatically the author of a given text sample.

Hence, this paper tries to fill the gap and proposes two novelties that improve the effectiveness of traditional AA approaches for this type of data: the first is to adopt features inspired by Conversation Analysis (in particular for turn-taking), the second is to extract the features from individual turns rather than from entire conversations. The experiments have been performed over a corpus of dyadic chat conversations (77 individuals in total).

Text Classification for Authorship Attribution Using Naive Bayes Classifier with Limited Training Data,2014,,38,"Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying authors of disputed or anonymous texts. It can be seen as a single, multi-class text classification task. It is concerned with writing style rather than topic matter. The scalability issue in traditional AA studies concerns the effect of data size, the amount of data per candidate author. This has not been probed in much depth yet, since most stylometry researches tend to focus on long texts per author or multiple short texts, because stylistic choices frequently occur less in such short texts. This paper investigates the task of authorship attribution on short historical Arabic texts written by10 different authors. Several experiments are conducted on these texts by extracting various lexical and character features of the writing style of each author, using N-grams word level (1,2,3, and 4) and character level (1,2,3, and 4) grams as a text representation. Then Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is employed in order to classify the texts to their authors. This is to show robustness of NB classifier in doing AA on very short-sized texts when compared to Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using dataset (called AAAT) which consists of 3 short texts per author’s book, it is shown our method is at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) for the selection of the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the significance of punctuation marks is explored in order to distinguish between authors, showing that an increase in the performance can be achieved. As well, the NB classifier achieved high accuracy results. Since the experiments of AA task that are done on AAAT dataset show interesting results with a classification accuracy of the best score obtained up to 96% using N-gram word level 1gram.

Detection of Online Contract Cheating Through Stylometry: A Pilot Study,2020,https://doi.org/10.24059/olj.v24i2.2096,37,"Contract cheating, instances in which a student enlists someone other than themselves to produce coursework, has been identified as a growing problem within academic integrity literature and in news headlines. The percentage of students who have utilized this type of cheating has been reported to range between 6% and 15.7%. Generational sentiments about cheating and the prevalent accessibility of contract cheating providers online seems to only have exacerbated the issue. The problem is that there is currently no simple means identified and verified to detect contract cheating, as available plagiarism detection software has been shown to be ineffective in these cases. One method that is commonly used for authorship authentication in nonacademic settings, stylometry, has been suggested as a potential means for detection. Stylometry uses various attributes of documents to determine if they were written by the same individual. This pilot study sought to assess the utility of three easy to use and readily available stylometry software systems to detect simulated cases of contract cheating on academic documents. Average accuracy ranged from 33% to 88.9%. While more research is necessary to further investigate the reliability of the best performing software packages, stylometry software appears to show significant promise for the potential detection of contract cheating.","['Cheating', 'Stylometry', 'Coursework', 'Academic integrity', 'Plagiarism detection', 'Computer science', 'Software', 'Malware', 'Academic dishonesty', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Internet privacy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics education', 'Programming language']",['David Ison'],29,True,Online Learning,[],2,80.6670023497818,0.0004867332307247063,0.6666666666666666,0.20034071326150726
E-mail authorship attribution using customized associative classification,2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2015.05.012,36,"E-mail communication is often abused for conducting social engineering attacks including spamming, phishing, identity theft and for distributing malware. This is largely attributed to the problem of anonymity inherent in the standard electronic mail protocol. In the literature, authorship attribution is studied as a text categorization problem where the writing styles of individuals are modeled based on their previously written sample documents. The developed model is employed to identify the most plausible writer of the text. Unfortunately, most existing studies focus solely on improving predictive accuracy and not on the inherent value of the evidence collected. In this study, we propose a customized associative classification technique, a popular data mining method, to address the authorship attribution problem.

Consequently, naïve application of NSC methodology can produce misleading results. We extend the NSC methodology for more general application to stylometry.

The texts from different authors were represented by tones, tone motifs, and word length motifs as well as rimes and rime motifs. Support vector machines and random forests were used to establish the text classification model for authorship attribution. From the results of the experiments, we conclude that the combination of bigrams of rimes, word-final rimes, and segment -final rimes can discriminate the texts from different authors effectively when using random forests to establish the classification model. This robust approach can in principle be applied to other languages with established phonological inventory of onset and rimes.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Bigram', 'Lexicalization', 'Speech recognition', 'Trigram']","['Renkui Hou', 'Chu‐Ren Huang']",85,False,Natural Language Engineering,[],2,74.296408190668,0.00032887380454372047,0.6666666666666666,0.20023021166318059
Arabic Authorship Attribution,2018,https://doi.org/10.1145/3236391,22,"Law enforcement faces problems in tracing the true identity of offenders in cybercrime investigations. Most offenders mask their true identity, impersonate people of high authority, or use identity deception and obfuscation tactics to avoid detection and traceability. To address the problem of anonymity, authorship analysis is used to identify individuals by their writing styles without knowing their actual identities. Most authorship studies are dedicated to English due to its widespread use over the Internet, but recent cyber-attacks such as the distribution of Stuxnet indicate that Internet crimes are not limited to a certain community, language, culture, ideology, or ethnicity. To effectively investigate cybercrime and to address the problem of anonymity in online communication, there is a pressing need to study authorship analysis of languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, and so on. Arabic, the focus of this study, is the fourth most widely used language on the Internet. This study investigates authorship of Arabic discourse/text, especially tiny text, Twitter posts. We benchmark the performance of a profile-based approach that uses n -grams as features and compare it with state-of-the-art instance-based classification techniques. Then we adapt an event-visualization tool that is developed for English to accommodate both Arabic and English languages and visualize the result of the attribution evidence. In addition, we investigate the relative effect of the training set, the length of tweets, and the number of authors on authorship classification accuracy.

De‐anonymizing Ethereum blockchain smart contracts through code attribution,2020,https://doi.org/10.1002/nem.2130,22,"Summary Blockchain users are identified by addresses (public keys), which cannot be easily linked back to them without out‐of‐network information. This provides pseudo‐anonymity, which is amplified when the user generates a new address for each transaction. Since all transaction history is visible to all users in public blockchains, finding affiliation between related addresses undermines pseudo‐anonymity. Such affiliation information can be used to discriminate against addresses linked with undesired activities or can lead to de‐anonymization if out‐of‐network information becomes available. In this work, we propose an approach to undermine pseudo‐anonymity of blockchain transactions by linking together addresses that were used to deploy smart contracts, which were produced by the same authors. In our approach, we leverage stylometry techniques, widely used in the social science field for attribution of literary texts to their corresponding authors. The assumption underlying authorship attribution is the existence of a distinctive writing style, unique to an author and easily distinguishable from others. Drawing an analogy between literary text and smart contracts' source code, we explore the extent to which unique features of source code and byte code of Ethereum smart contracts can represent the coding style of smart contract developers. We show that even a small number of representative features leads to a sufficiently high accuracy in attributing smart contracts' code to its deployer's address. We further validate our approach on real‐world scammers' data and Ponzi scheme‐related contracts.

The authors have mainly focused on each of the article selected for review (2010-16), by summarizing the authorship detection fields, the corpus, the features of authorship analysis, and authorship attribution techniques used which could provide a platform to distinguish between different research contributions and the diverse techniques used in classifying the author's texts. The details on common tools and authorship attribution techniques published in the recent past would be of importance to the concerned researchers as an aid towards text data mining and future growth in the study of authorship attribution.","['Authorship attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Identification (biology)', 'Data science', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Attribution', 'Information retrieval', 'Natural language processing', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Botany', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Biology']","['Siddharth Swain', 'Gaurav Mishra', 'C.

Analysis of Stylometric Variables in Long and Short Texts,2013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.688,18,"This paper presents some experiments in the task of authorship attribution. We achieve this task by a stylometric analysis of some stylistic markers tested in two Spanish corpora. The first corpus is composed of long texts written by professional authors, while the second corpus is formed by short texts written by students. In both corpora, different text genres are included. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze several stylometric variables to test its capacity as markers for authorship attribution when the corpora vary in size and text genre. We represent the texts as high dimensional vectors and we visualize the similarities between them using multidimensional scaling. We conclude that the length of texts is a factor that affects the discriminatory capacity of the stylometric variables. We also found that there are certain variables that are better than others to identify specific authors and specific text genres.","['Authorship attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Task (project management)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Test (biology)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Biology', 'Paleontology', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Philosophy']","['Fernanda López‐Escobedo', 'Carlos-Francisco Méndez-Cruz', 'Gerardo Sierra', 'Julián Solórzano-Soto']",18,True,Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,[],2,68.74958039610608,0.00023678913927147876,0.6666666666666666,0.20016575239749002

Big data or not enough? Zeta test reliability and the attribution of <i>Henry VI</i>,2020,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqaa041,16,"Abstract In 2016, the editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare announced that certain Shakespeare plays could be attributed to co-authors, and certain anonymous plays to Shakespeare, on the basis of non-traditional attribution methods known collectively as computational stylistics, or stylometry. This article investigates the efficacy of a key algorithm used to attribute parts of the Henry VI plays to Christopher Marlowe, the Zeta method invented by John Burrows and adapted by Hugh Craig. Zeta, a test widely used in computational stylistics, is described by Gabriel Egan as ‘by some way the most powerful general-purpose authorship tool currently available’. This article offers extensive independent testing of Zeta. Following criticism of the existing method of Zeta analysis, this article introduces a new, statistically sound method for analysing Zeta results. It investigates a claim that the test is 99.9% reliable in differentiating Shakespeare’s style from Marlowe’s. Examining the conditions under which certain authors were ruled in or out of co-authorship of the Henry VI plays, it determines the effect of disparity in data set size on Zeta’s reliability, as well the effect of small data sets. Several test results confirm that Zeta is unduly influenced by genre. The article concludes that in the light of this study, the small canons of most Early Modern dramatists, particularly where they are genre-skewed like Marlowe’s, do not provide enough data for Zeta to be reliable","['Stylometry', 'Criticism', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Variance (accounting)', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics education', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Paleontology', 'Power (physics)', 'Accounting', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Business']",['R.

In an important recent book Anthony Kenny puts forward a conclusion phrased in terms which reflect the judicious caution of one well versed in philosophy.

However, these studies are generally limited to (i) a small number of candidate authors, and (ii) documents with similar lengths. In this paper, we propose a novel solution by modeling authorship attribution as a set similarity problem to overcome the two stated limitations.

Integration of Static and Dynamic Code Stylometry Analysis for Programmer De-anonymization,2018,https://doi.org/10.1145/3270101.3270110,14,"De-anonymizing the authors of anonymous code (i.e., code stylometry) entails significant privacy and security implications. Most existing code stylometry methods solely rely on static (e.g., lexical, layout, and syntactic) features extracted from source code, while neglecting its key difference from regular text -- it is executable! In this paper, we present Sundae, a novel code de-anonymization framework that integrates both static and dynamic stylometry analysis. Compared with the existing solutions, Sundae departs in significant ways: (i) it requires much less number of static, hand-crafted features; (ii) it requires much less labeled data for training; and (iii) it can be readily extended to new programmers once their stylometry information becomes available Through extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Sundae delivers strong empirical performance. For example, under the setting of 229 programmers and 9 problems, it outperforms the state-of-art method by a margin of 45.65% on Python code de-anonymization.

In our study, we faced building a balanced corpus from few available resources, and took extensive evaluation measures to deal with unclear stylometric signals. We use a variety of established attribution and verification methods, and introduce a novel evaluation procedure of examining historic texts with scarce corpora.

"Does Size Matter?

Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size. Although the tests have been performed using the Delta method ( Burrows, J.F . (2002). ‘Delta’: a measure of stylistic difference and a guide to likely authorship.

Four popular distance measures established in stylometric research are evaluated for the genre detection task. Findings The results of the experiments show that stylometry-based genre clustering and classification align well with human-defined genre. The evidence suggests that genre style signals exist for Classical Arabic and can be used to support the task of automated genre detection. Originality/value This work targets the task of genre detection in Classical Arabic text using stylometric features, an approach that has only been previously applied to Arabic authorship attribution.

The features are based on the concept of network motifs: small graph local substructures which have been used successfully in characterizing global network dynamics. The text is transformed into a network, where words become nodes and their adjacencies in a sentence are represented through links. Motifs of size 3 are then extracted from this network and their distribution is used as a signature for the corresponding translator.

The biographies describe the lives of emperors and usurpers of a great part of the second and third centuries of our era, and constitute an imperfect, yet important source of information on this poorly documented time. The attempts to demonstrate single authorship have been based upon internal evidence and linguistic analysis. This paper describes various statistical analyses of word frequencies of the fully lemmatized and disambiguated texts of the work, and demonstrates that not only has multiple authorship not been disproved, but also that the manuscript tradition attributing specific biographies to stated authors has very clearly not been overturned.","['Attribution', 'Authorship attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Literature', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Penelope J.

Stylometrics of artwork: uses and limitations,2010,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.838849,10,"A number of digital image analysis techniques have been developed in recent years to address art historical questions. These techniques allow non-destructive analyses of art images that can target outstanding problems of attribution, historical ordering, and other stylistic dimensions. However, great care must be taken in designing the comparisons to which these techniques are applied. In this paper, we review recent work by our lab and by others aimed at establishing a toolbox of stylometrics, and we discuss some of the uses and limitations of these methods. We describe a technique that provides robust classification of authentic drawings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and we demonstrate new techniques for art historical analysis applied to the works of other masters. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of two low-level statistics (the slope of the log amplitude spectrum and color histogram correlation) to analyze the works of Picasso and Braque. Finally, we show that face detection and recognition techniques may play a useful role in the attribution of works of art. The rationale for employing vision coding-like methods (e.g., sparse coding) in stylometry is also reviewed. We conclude that generic authentication tools are unlikely to provide reliable stylometric predictions but that with careful construction of comparison sets - which we believe must be done in close collaboration with art historians - these techniques provide important predictions that can be weighed against other art historical evidence. We argue further that concurrent predictions derived from analysis of many independent dimensions of image data (e.g., color, luminance, and spatial statistics) provide the strongest evidence for digital stylometric determinations.","['Computer science', 'Stylometry', 'Toolbox', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Histogram', 'Coding (social sciences)', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Programming language']","['James M.

Authorship Attribution for a Resource Poor Language—Urdu,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3487061,10,"Authorship attribution refers to examining the writing style of authors to determine the likelihood of the original author of a document from a given set of potential authors. Due to the wide range of authorship attribution applications, a plethora of studies have been conducted for various Western, as well as Asian, languages. However, authorship attribution research in the Urdu language has just begun, although Urdu is widely acknowledged as a prominent South Asian language. Furthermore, the existing studies on authorship attribution in Urdu have addressed a considerably easier problem of having less than 20 candidate authors, which is far from the real-world settings. Therefore, the findings from these studies may not be applicable to the real-world settings. To that end, we have made three key contributions: First, we have developed a large authorship attribution corpus for Urdu, which is a low-resource language. The corpus is composed of over 2.6 million tokens and 21,938 news articles by 94 authors, which makes it a closer substitute to the real-world settings. Second, we have analyzed hundreds of stylometry features used in the literature to identify 194 features that are applicable to the Urdu language and developed a taxonomy of these features. Finally, we have performed 66 experiments using two heterogeneous datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of four traditional and three deep learning techniques. The experimental results show the following: (a) Our developed corpus is many folds larger than the existing corpora, and it is more challenging than its counterparts for the authorship attribution task, and (b) Convolutional Neutral Networks is the most effective technique, as it achieved a nearly perfect F1 score of 0.989 for an existing corpus and 0.910 for our newly developed corpus.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Urdu', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Resource (disambiguation)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Taxonomy (biology)', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Computer network', 'Philosophy', 'Botany', 'Biology', 'Programming language', 'Archaeology']","['Zulqarnain Nazir', 'Khurram Shahzad', 'Muhammad Kamran Malik', 'Waheed Anwar', 'Imran Sarwar Bajwa', 'Khawar Mehmood']",44,False,ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing,[],2,59.23766364551864,0.00013154952181748818,0.6666666666666666,0.20009208466527223

Development of the quantitative method for automated text content authorship attribution based on the statistical analysis of N-grams distribution,2019,https://doi.org/10.15587/1729-4061.2019.186834,9,"The peculiarities of the application of linguo-statistics technologies for the identification of the style of the author of text content of scientific and technical profile are considered. Quantitative linguistic analysis of a text uses the benefits of content monitoring based on the NLP methods to identify and analyze the set of stop words, keywords, set phrases and to study N-gram. The latter are used in the linguometry methods to determine in per cent if the given text belongs to a particular author. The quantitative method for automatic text content authorship attribution was developed based on statistical analysis of the 3-gram distribution. The approach to the implementation of identification of the author of the text in the Ukrainian language of the scientific and technical profile was proposed. Experimental results of the proposed method to determine the belonging of the analyzed text to a specific author in the presence of the reference text were obtained. Application of the linguo-statistical analysis of the 3-grams to a set of articles will make it possible to form a subset of publications that are similar in linguistic descriptions. Imposing additional conditions in the form of statistical and quantitative analyses (a set of keywords, set expressions, stylometric, linguometric analyses, etc.) on a subset will allow a significant reduction of this subset by specifying the list of the most likely author. For qualitative and effective content analysis when determining the degree of authorship of a particular author, we propose to analyze the reference text and the one under consideration at several stages: linguometric analysis of the coefficients of the diversity of the author's speech, stylometric analysis, analysis of set expressions, linguo-statistical analysis of 3-grams.

Register variation explains stylometric authorship analysis,2023,https://doi.org/10.1515/cllt-2022-0040,8,"Abstract For centuries, investigations of disputed authorship have shown that people have unique styles of writing. Given sufficient data, it is generally possible to distinguish between the writings of a small group of authors, for example, through the multivariate analysis of the relative frequencies of common function words. There is, however, no accepted explanation for why this type of stylometric analysis is successful. Authorship analysts often argue that authors write in subtly different dialects, but the analysis of individual words is not licensed by standard theories of sociolinguistic variation. Alternatively, stylometric analysis is consistent with standard theories of register variation. In this paper, I argue that stylometric methods work because authors write in subtly different registers. To support this claim, I present the results of parallel stylometric and multidimensional register analyses of a corpus of newspaper articles written by two columnists. I demonstrate that both analyses not only distinguish between these authors but identify the same underlying patterns of linguistic variation. I therefore propose that register variation, as opposed to dialect variation, provides a basis for explaining these differences and for explaining stylometric analyses of authorship more generally.","['Variation (astronomy)', 'Register (sociolinguistics)', 'Stylometry', 'Newspaper', 'Computer science', 'Linguistics', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Astrophysics', 'Media studies']",['Jack Grieve'],38,True,Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory,[],2,55.869754951325945,0.00010523961745399055,0.6666666666666666,0.20007366773221777

Stylometry and Numerals Usage: Benford’s Law and Beyond,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/stats4040060,7,"We suggest two approaches to the statistical analysis of texts, both based on the study of numerals occurrence in literary texts. The first approach is related to Benford’s Law and the analysis of the frequency distribution of various leading digits of numerals contained in the text. In coherent literary texts, the share of the leading digit 1 is even larger than prescribed by Benford’s Law and can reach 50 percent. The frequencies of occurrence of the digit 1, as well as, to a lesser extent, the digits 2 and 3, are usually a characteristic the author’s style feature, manifested in all (sufficiently long) literary texts of any author. This approach is convenient for testing whether a group of texts has common authorship: the latter is dubious if the frequency distributions are sufficiently different. The second approach is the extension of the first one and requires the study of the frequency distribution of numerals themselves (not their leading digits).

Authorship attribution of short texts using multi-layer perceptron,2018,https://doi.org/10.1504/ijapr.2018.10016100,7,"Authorship attribution using stylometry techniques to analyse texts has grown out from earlier times for verifying the authenticity of evidence, authorial identity among other things. With the advent of the digital era, traditional pen paper writing is replaced by electronic documents making earlier techniques of handwriting analysis impossible because their electronic nature eliminates the informative differences in authorial style. Previously, authorship attributions focused mainly on unmasking the author of long pieces of digital texts but in this study, we are going to do the same for short texts that are shared on social platforms and boards. We have used a multi-layer perceptron to correctly attribute short texts to their authors using a Twitter dataset of four authors and 400 tweets for each author with 96.44% accuracy.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Handwriting', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Computer science', 'Layer (electronics)', 'Perceptron', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'Artificial neural network', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Chemistry', 'Organic chemistry']","['Pratyush Das', 'Nilan Saha', 'Himadri Nath Saha']",0,False,International Journal of Applied Pattern Recognition,[],2,53.91171534071836,9.208466527224174e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20006445926569055
Authorship Attribution on Bengali Literature using Stylometric Features and Neural Network,2018,https://doi.org/10.1109/ceeict.2018.8628106,7,"Every writer has his/her personal writing style. In the era of technology, authorship attribution is a big problem in natural language processing because fake writers can publish other writers' contents and it is difficult to identify the real author. Various kinds of features such as frequently used words, word length, sentence length, WH words, Number, etc. were analyzed to identify and specify a writer's writing style. A statistical analysis of different articles by different writers was created that can identify the real author. An artificial neural network model was developed to identify a writer from an unknown document and it achieved above 85% accuracy rate for each writer. In this article, writings of five Bangladeshi authors named Imon Jubayer (IJ), Humayun Ahmed (HA), Muhammed Zafar Iqbal (MZI), Kazi Nazrul Islam (KNI) and Hassan Mahbub (HM) are observed.","['Bengali', 'Authorship attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Artificial neural network', 'Computer science', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Natural language processing']","['Md.

Finding characteristic features in stylometric analysis,2015,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqv048,7,"The usual focus in authorship studies is on authorship attribution, i.e. determining which author (of a given set) wrote a piece of unknown provenance. The usual setting involves a small number of candidate authors, which means that the focus quickly revolves around a search for features that discriminate among the candidates. Whether the features that serve to discriminate among the authors are characteristic is then not of primary importance. We respectfully suggest an alternative in this article, namely a focus on seeking features that are characteristic for an author with respect to others. To determine an author’s characteristic features, we first seek elements that he or she uses consistently, which we therefore regard as ‘representative’, but we likewise seek elements which the author uses ‘distinctively’ in comparison to an opposing author. We test the idea on a task recently proposed that compares Charles Dickens to both Wilkie Collins and a larger reference set comprising several authors’ works from the 18th and 19th century. We then compare the use of representative and distinctive features to Burrows’ ‘Delta’ and Hoovers’ ‘CoV Tuning’; we find that our method bears little similarity with either method in terms of characteristic feature selection. We show that our method achieves reliable and consistent results in the two-author comparison and fair results in the multi-author one, measured by separation ability in clustering.","['Focus (optics)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Stylometry', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Computer science', 'Task (project management)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Cluster analysis', 'Selection (genetic algorithm)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Information retrieval', 'Natural language processing', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Linguistics', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Engineering', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Systems engineering', 'Optics', 'Programming language']","['Carmen Klaussner', 'John Nerbonne', 'Çağrı Çöltekin']",21,True,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,[],2,53.91171534071836,9.208466527224174e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20006445926569055
A Scientometric Study of the Stylometric Research Field,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/informatics9030060,6,"Stylometry has gained great popularity in digital humanities and social sciences. Many works on stylometry have recently been reported. However, there is a research gap regarding review studies in this field from a bibliometric and evolutionary perspective. Therefore, in this paper, a bibliometric analysis of publications from the Scopus database in the stylometric research field was proposed. Then, research articles published between 1968 and 2021 were collected and analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package for bibliometric analysis via the Biblioshiny web interface. Empirical results were also presented in terms of the performance analysis and the science mapping analysis. From these results, it is concluded that there has been a strong growth in stylometry research in recent years, while the USA, Poland, and the UK are the most productive countries, and this is due to many strong research partnerships. It was also concluded that the research topics of most articles, based on author keywords, focused on two broad thematic categories: (1) the main tasks in stylometry and (2) methodological approaches (statistics and machine learning methods).","['Stylometry', 'Popularity', 'Scopus', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Web of science', 'Data science', 'Bibliometrics', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Scientometrics', 'Computer science', 'Library science', 'Political science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Mathematics', 'MEDLINE', 'Law', 'Pure mathematics']",['Panagiotis D.

Towards a Linguistic Stylometric Model for the Authorship Detection in Cybercrime Investigations,2019,https://doi.org/10.5539/ijel.v9n5p182,6,"This study proposes an integrated framework that considers letter-pair frequencies/combinations along with the lexical features of documents as a means to identifying the authorship of short texts posted anonymously on social media. Taking a quantitative morpho-lexical approach, this study tests the hypothesis that letter information, or mapping, can identify unique stylistic features. As such, stable word combinations and morphological patterns can be used successfully for authorship detection in relation to very short texts. This method offers significant potential in the fight against online hate speech, which is often posted anonymously and where authorship is difficult to identify. The data analyzed is from a corpus of 12,240 tweets derived from 87 Twitter accounts. A self-organizing map (SOM) model was used to classify input patterns in the tweets that shared common features. Tweets grouped in a particular class displayed features that suggested they were written by a particular author. The results indicate that the accuracy of classification according to the proposed system was around 76%. Up to 22% of this accuracy was lost, however, when only distinctive words were used and 26% was lost when the classification procedure was based solely on letter combinations and morphological patterns. The integration of letter-pairs and morphological patterns had the advantage of improving accuracy when determining the author of a given tweet. This indicates that the integration of different linguistic variables into an integrated system leads to better performance in classifying very short texts. It is also clear that the use of a self-organizing map (SOM) led to better clustering performance because of its capacity to integrate two different linguistic levels for each author profile.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Class (philosophy)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Word (group theory)', 'Part of speech', 'Stylometry', 'Relation (database)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Data mining', 'Philosophy']","['Abdulfattah Omar', 'Aldawsari Bader Deraan']",25,True,International Journal of English Linguistics,[],2,51.676401477005705,7.892971309049292e-05,0.6666666666666666,0.20005525079916334
