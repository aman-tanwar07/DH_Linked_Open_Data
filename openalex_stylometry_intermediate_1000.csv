Depressive attributional style.,1979,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-843x.88.3.242,1080,"Depressed college students, compared to nondepressed college students, attributed bad outcomes to internal, stable, and global causes, as measured by an attributional style scale. This attributional style was predicted by the reformulated helplessness model of depression. In addition, relative to nondepressed students, depressed students attributed good outcomes to external, unstable causes. Recently, Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale (1978) proposed an attributional reformulation of the learned helplessness hypothesis. This reformulation resolves a number of the inadequacies of the original hypothesis when applied to human helplessness and depression. According to the reformulated hypothesis, the kinds of causal attributions people make for lack of control influence whether their helplessness will entail low selfesteem and whether their helplessness will generalize across situations and time. Abramson et al. argued that three attributional dimensions are crucial for explaining human helplessness and depression: internal-external, stable-unstable, and global-specific. In brief, the reformulated model asserts that attributing lack of control to internal factors leads to lowered self-esteem, whereas attributing lack of control to external factors does not. Furthermore, attributing lack of control to stable factors should lead to helplessness deficits extended across time, and attributing lack of control to global factors should lead to wide generalization of help","['Learned helplessness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Generalization', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Control (management)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Depression (economics)', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Management', 'Macroeconomics', 'Economics']","['Martin E.

Attributional style in depression: A meta-analytic review.,1986,https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.50.5.974,589,"In this article we report meta-analyses of the relation of attributional styles to depression. In 104 studies involving nearly 15,000 subjects, several attributional patterns had reliable associations with depression scores. For negative events, attributions to internal, stable, and global causes had a reliable and significant association with depression. Studies in which the attribution factors of ability and luck were measured also showed a reliable association with depression. For positive events, attributions to external, unstable, and specific causes were associated with depression. Ability and luck attribution factors for positive events were also associated with depression. The relations for positive events, however, were weaker than the corresponding ones for negative events. In general, these patterns of relations were independent of a number of potential mediators suggested by authors in this literature, including the type of subject studied (psychiatric vs. college student), the type of event about which the attribution is made (real vs. simulated), the depression measure used, or the publication status of the research report. These conclusions are compared with those of other reviews.

Four latent traits emerged from scales assessing such differences—Intensity, Attention, Expression, and Clarity. In both samples, these latent traits were found to be involved in reports of personality, well-being, coping, and explanatory style. Clarity was positively associated with measures of positive well-being and negatively associated with measures of negative well-being. Individuals who experience intense emotions (Intensity), who attend to them often (Attention), or who notably express them (Expression), reported coping by focusing on and venting their emotions and by seeking social support. Individuals who are adept at identifying their emotions (Clarity) reported engaging in active, planful coping and in positive reinterpretations of events.

Cross-situational consistency in causal attributions: Does attributional style exist?,1984,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.47.5.1043,148,"Two studies are reported that critically evaluate the concept of an attributional style, as operationalized by the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ).

An attempt to identify individuals who tended to be very consistent in their causal attributions on the ASQ similarly did not provide strong support for the attributional style concept. In Study 2 the relation between scores on the ASQ and causal attributions for actual negative events was examined.

Attributional style and the generality of learned helplessness.,1984,https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.46.3.681,223,"According to the logic of the attribution reformulation of learned helplessness, the interaction of two factors influences whether helplessness experienced in one situation will transfer to a new situation. The model predicts that people who exhibit a style of attributing negative outcomes to global factors will show helplessness deficits in new situations that are either similar or dissimilar to the original situation in which they were helpless. In contrast, people who exhibit a style of attributing negative outcomes to only specific factors will show helplessness deficits in situations that are similar, but not dissimilar, to the original situation in which they were helpless. To test these predictions, we conducted two studies in which undergraduates with either a global or specific attributional style for negative outcomes were given one of three pretreatments in the typical helplessness triadic design: controllable bursts of noise, uncontrollable bursts of noise, or no noise. In Experiment 1, students were tested for helplessness deficits in a test situation similar to the pretreatment setting, whereas in Experiment 2, they were tested in a test situation dissimilar to the pretreatment setting.

This prediction was tested by following a group of depressed college students longitudinally for 6 weeks. Although neither positive events alone nor attributional style alone predicted reduction in hopelessness, depressives who both showed the enhancing attributional style for positive events and experienced more positive events showed dramatic reductions in hopelessness which were accompanied by remission of depressive symptoms.

Style-markers in authorship attribution : a cross-language study of the authorial fingerprint,2011,,65,"The present study addresses one of the theoretical problems of computer-assisted authorship attribution, namely the question which traceable features of language can betray authorial uniqueness (a stylistic fingerprint) of literary texts. A number of recent approaches show that apart from lexical measures — especially those relying on the frequencies of the most frequent words — also some other features of written language are considerably effective as discriminators of authorial style. However, there have been no attempts to compare the attribution potential of these features. The aim of the present study, then, was to examine the effectiveness of several style-markers in authorship attribution. The style-markers chosen for the empirical investigation are those that can be retrieved from a non-lemmatized corpus of plain text files, such as the most frequent words, word bi-grams, different letter sequences, and markers of different nature, combined in one sample. Equally important, however, was to compare usefulness of the chosen style-markers across a few languages: English, Polish, German, and Latin. The results confirmed a high attribution effectiveness of word-based style-markers in the English corpus, but the alternative markers are shown to be usually more effective in the other languages.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'German', 'Linguistics', 'Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Writing style', 'Natural language processing', 'Fingerprint (computing)', 'Word (group theory)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy']",['Maciej Eder'],27,False,Studies in Polish Linguistics,[]

Attributional styles and life events in the classroom: Vulnerability and invulnerability to depressive mood reactions.,1982,https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.43.3.612,244,"A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with the same negative life event, people who display a generalized tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors. We tested this prediction with a prospective design in a naturalistic setting by determining whether the content of college students' attributional styles at one point in time predicted the severity of their depressive mood response to receiving a low grade on a midterm exam at a subsequent point in time. Consistent with the prediction, students with an internal or global attributional style for negative outcomes at Time 1 experienced a depressive mood response when confronted with a subsequent low midterm grade, whereas students with an external or specific attributional style for negative outcomes were invulnerable to this depressive mood response. In contrast to the results for the internality and globality dimensions, students' scores along the stability attribution dimension were not correlated with the severity of their depressive mood response to the low midterm grade. In the absence of a negative life event (i.e., receipt of a high midterm grade), students' generalized tendencies to make internal or global attributions for negative outcomes at Time 1 were not significantly correlated with their subsequent changes in depressive mood although there was a nonsignificant positive correlation between severity of depressive mood response and the tendency to make global attributions for negative outcomes at Time 1.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Learned helplessness', 'Mood', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive vulnerability', 'Association (psychology)', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Experience sampling method', 'Depression (economics)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapist', 'Anxiety', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Gerald I.

A questionnaire was formed, consisting of 20 hypothetical situations. Half of the situations were interpersonal, and half were not; half described successful outcomes, and half described failures. The subject selected an attributional alternative that best explained the outcome. The questionnaire was administered to 304 students, along with the Beck Depression Inventory and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The results showed that lonely and depressed people ascribe interpersonal failures to unchangeable characterological defects in themselves (e.g., a lack of ability). Because the prototype of a lonely person is more singularly interpersonal than is the prototype of a depressed person, we hypothesized that loneliness would show higher correlations with the attributional style. This hypothesis was also confirmed. The findings were replicated using a modified version of the questionnaire.","['Loneliness', 'Psychology', 'UCLA Loneliness Scale', 'Attribution', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Beck Depression Inventory', 'Interpersonal relationship', 'Social psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Anxiety', 'Archaeology', 'History']","['Craig A.

Overt Anger in Response to Victimization: Attributional Style and Organizational Norms as Moderators.,2004,https://doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.9.2.152,169,Prior theory and research suggests a positive relation between perceived victimization and overt anger. The authors proposed and tested a theoretical extension of this link by investigating possible moderating effects of individual and contextual variables. A sample of 158 employees of a municipality was used to test hypotheses that the relationship between perceived victimization and overt anger is moderated by hostile attributional style and perceptions of organizational norms. The results showed that the relation between perceptions of direct victimization and overt anger was stronger when the employee had a more rather than less hostile attributional style and when the employee perceived the organizational norms as more rather than less oppositional.,"['Psychology', 'Anger', 'Social psychology', 'Perception', 'Attribution', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Moderated mediation', 'Archaeology', 'Neuroscience', 'History']","['Karl Aquino', 'Scott Douglas', 'Mark J.

Subjects in the two preselected groups (characterstyle versus behavioral-style attributors) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental manipulations of attributions for failure at an interpersonal persuasion task: (a) no manipulation, (b) ability/trait manipulation (which parallels the character style), or (c) strategy/effort manipulation (which parallels the behavior style). Subsequently, subjects engaged in a blood drive task over the telephone, trying to persuade other students to donate blood. Success expectancies, motivation, and actual performance were assessed. As predicted, subjects who made strategy-/efforttype attributions, whether by experimental manipulation or by preselection, expected more success, expected more improvement with practice, displayed higher levels of motivation, and performed better at the task than did subjects who made ability/trait-type attributions.

The comparison involved randomly assigning 150 outpatients with major depression to a treatment focused exclusively on the behavioral activation (BA) component of CT, a treatment that included both BA and the teaching of skills to modify automatic thoughts (AT), but excluding the components of CT focused on core schema, or the full CT treatment. Four experienced cognitive therapists conducted all treatments. Despite excellent adherence to treatment protocols by the therapists, a clear bias favoring CT, and the competent performance of CT, there was no evidence that the complete treatment produced better outcomes, at either the termination of acute treatment or the 6-month follow-up, than either component treatment. Furthermore, both BA and AT treatments were just as effective as CT at altering negative thinking as well as dysfunctional attributional styles. Finally, attributional style was highly predictive of both short- and long-term outcomes in the BA condition, but not in the CT condition.","['Psychology', 'Schema (genetic algorithms)', 'Dysfunctional family', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive therapy', 'Cognitive restructuring', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Behavioral activation', 'Cognitive behavioral therapy', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychiatry', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Neil S.

An investigation of attributional style in first‐episode psychosis,1999,https://doi.org/10.1348/014466599162737,74,"Objective. The present study investigated covert and overt attributional styles in individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis. It was hypothesized that those individuals experiencing paranoia, as operationalized by higher scores on the suspiciousness item of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) would perform differently on both covert and overt measures of attributional style when compared to those individuals who scored lower on the BPRS suspiciousness item. Design and Methods. A cross‐sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 62 participants (50 males and 12 females) from the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre. The Pragmatic Inference Task (PIT) was used to measure covert attributional style, whereas the Attributional Style Questionnaire (parallel form; ASQpf) measured overt attributional style. The Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Questionnaire measured global self‐esteem. Participants positive, negative, and depressive symptoms were assessed by means of the BPRS, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. Results. Regression analyses found that less suspiciousness ( p =.02) and more depression ( p =.02) predicted higher internal attributions for negative events scores on the ASQpf. There was a trend ( p =.07) for more suspicious individuals to endorse the self‐serving bias (SSB) on the PIT, even despite the SSB not being large enough to be considered defensive. Verbal IQ emerged as a significant predictor of covert attributional style ( p =.04). Conclusions. The findings suggest that increasing suspiciousness does predict attributional style in the early stages of psychosis, although the relationship appears weaker than in reports with more chronic psychotic patient samples. Longitudinal research is needed to ascertain whether attributional style is a stable characteristic in psychosis, or whether it fluctuates between periods of remission and active psychosis.","['Psychology', 'Psychosis', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Archaeology', 'History']","['Helen Krstev', 'Henry J.

The following predictions were made: (1) mothers would be above chance in the accuracy by which they predicted their children's overall attributional styles; (2) increased maternal accuracy would be an important correlate of reduced psychopathology symptoms in children; and (3) poor maternal accuracy would associate with a maladaptive child attributional response style characterized by unrealistic and overly positive attributions. Results suggested that maternal accuracy was normally distributed with mothers accurately guessing the responses of their children for about half of the social scenarios. Furthermore, mothers were shown to be above chance in the accuracy by which they predicted their children's overall attributional styles.

The PG group displayed externality in their causal attributions for bad events but those in the NPG group did not differ from controls. Both deluded groups were significantly more stable in their attributions for bad events in comparison to controls.

Celebrity Scandal Fallout: How Attribution Style Can Protect the Sponsor,2013,https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.20625,81,"ABSTRACT An attribution is an inference about why an event occurred or about a person's disposition or other psychological state. This study is designed to examine the effects of consumers’ attribution styles (i.e., dispositional and situational) and moderating role of celebrity identification and brand commitment in the evaluation of negative information about a celebrity endorser.

An alternate possibility is that attributing events in general to internal, stable, and global factors might lead to better social function. As a test of these hypotheses, 40 participants in a post-acute phase of schizophrenia were administered the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Quality of Life Scale. Stepwise multiple regressions controlling for age and education indicated that a lack of negative symptoms and the tendency to make stable attributions for life events in general predicted more frequent social contacts, a higher quality of social interaction, and better community participation on the Quality of Life Scale.

Association of Attributional Style for Negative and Positive Events and the Occurrence of Life Events with Depression and Anxiety,2006,https://doi.org/10.1521/jscp.2006.25.10.1140,73,"This study examined the relationship of attributional styles for negative and positive events with depression and anxiety. A sample of 239 college students underwent structured diagnostic interviews and completed self–report measures of attributional style and major life events at two time points separated by approximately four weeks. Using cross–sectional methodology, attributional styles for negative and positive events were compared across current diagnoses of unipolar depression and/or anxiety. A current mood disorder, when comorbid with an anxiety disorder, was associated with a tendency to see negative events as arising from internal, stable, and global causes. A depression diagnosis was distinguished from no depression diagnosis by the tendency to assign external, unstable, and specific causes for positive events. Using a prospective design, Time 1 attributional styles for negative and positive events were assessed as moderators of the relationships between negative and positive life events and levels of subsequent depression symptoms. The tendency to see negative events arising from internal, stable, and global causes and positive events arising from external, unstable, and specific causes, was associated with higher levels of clinician-assessed depression symptoms, particularly when confronted with negative life events or the absence of positive events. Findings indicate that attributional style for positive events contributes to our understanding of cognitive vulnerability to emotional disorders.","['Psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Attribution', 'Depression (economics)', 'Association (psychology)', 'Mood', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive vulnerability', 'Psychiatry', 'Developmental psychology', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['David M.

Design : Cross sectional survey. Setting : One general practice of eight doctors in Bristol. Subjects : 305 general practice attenders. Main outcome measure : The rate of detection by general practitioners of cases of depression and anxiety as defined by the general health questionnaire. Results : Consecutive attenders completed the general health questionnaire and the symptom interpretation questionnaire, which scores style of symptom attribution along the dimensions of psychologising, somatising, and normalising. General practitioners detected depression or anxiety in 56 (36%; 95% confidence interval 28% to 44%) of the 157 patients who scored highly on the general health questionnaire. Subjects with a normalising attributional style were less likely to be detected as cases; doctors did not make any psychological diagnosis in 46 (85%; 73% to 93%) of 54 patients who had high questionnaire and high normalising scores.

The pragmatics of politeness in scientific articles,1989,https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/10.1.1,881,"Recent studies of the pragmatics of politeness have drawn on conversational data. I argue that their model can be extended to some genres of written texts. There have been two obstacles to such an extension: the lack of a definite addressee for published texts, and the dificulty of defining relevant cultural variables. Taking a corpus of articles by molecular geneticists, I assume a simple model of a two-part audience, and focus on two kinds of impositions: claims and denials of claims. With this framework, one can see politeness claims and denials of claims. With this framework, one can see politeness strategies in regularities of scientific style—such as the use of pronouns and of passives—that are usually explained in terms of conventions. The analysis also accounts for some otherwise unexplained stylistic features, such as the use of adverbs in establishing solidarity, and the use of personal attribution in hedging. With these positive and negative politeness strategies in mind, we can understand better the social significance of the occasional instances in which the writer makes an imposition without redress, or makes the imposition indirectly or chooses not to make it at all. Comparisons with popularizations, a genre in which the writer has a different kind of relation to the reader, and thus uses different kinds of politeness devices, show that these devices arise in response to the interaction embodied in the text.","['Politeness', 'Pragmatics', 'Linguistics', 'Redress', 'Focus (optics)', 'Politeness maxims', 'Embodied cognition', 'Psychology', 'Relation (database)', 'Extension (predicate logic)', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Political science', 'Physics', 'Programming language', 'Optics', 'Database', 'Law']",['Glenn R.

An experiment in authorship attribution,2002,,134,"This paper reports an experiment in authorship attribution that reveals considerable authorial structure in texts written by authors with very similar background and training, with genre and topic being strictly controlled for. We interpret our results as supporting the hypothesis that authors have ’ textual fingerprints’, at least for texts produced by authors who are not consciously changing their style of writing across texts. What this study has also taught us is that discriminant analysis is a more appropriate technique to use than principal components analysis when predicting the authorship of an unknown (held-out) text on the basis of known (training) texts of which the authorial provenance is available. Finally, standard discriminant analysis can be enhanced considerably by using an entropy-based weighting scheme of the kind used in latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998).","['Authorship attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Latent semantic analysis', 'Linear discriminant analysis', 'Stylometry', 'Weighting', 'Linguistics', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Writing style', 'Information retrieval', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Medicine', 'Archaeology', 'Radiology']","['R.

Recognizing and Imitating Programmer Style: Adversaries in Program Authorship Attribution,2018,https://doi.org/10.1515/popets-2018-0007,28,"Abstract Source code attribution classifiers have recently become powerful. We consider the possibility that an adversary could craft code with the intention of causing a misclassification, i.e., creating a forgery of another author’s programming style in order to hide the forger’s own identity or blame the other author. We find that it is possible for a non-expert adversary to defeat such a system. In order to inform the design of adversarially resistant source code attribution classifiers, we conduct two studies with C/C++ programmers to explore the potential tactics and capabilities both of such adversaries and, conversely, of human analysts doing source code authorship attribution. Through the quantitative and qualitative analysis of these studies, we (1) evaluate a state-of-the-art machine classifier against forgeries, (2) evaluate programmers as human analysts/forgery detectors, and (3) compile a set of modifications made to create forgeries. Based on our analyses, we then suggest features that future source code attribution systems might incorporate in order to be adversarially resistant.","['Adversary', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Programmer', 'Source code', 'Blame', 'Authorship attribution', 'Code (set theory)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Computer security', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Programming language', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology']","['Lucy Simko', 'Luke Zettlemoyer', 'Tadayoshi Kohno']",18,True,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,[]

Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size.

"Attributional style, defensive functioning and persecutory delusions: Symptom-specific or general coping strategy?",2006,https://doi.org/10.1348/014466505x50509,54,"Objective. Previous research has suggested that individuals with persecutory delusions use an exaggerated self‐serving bias to protect themselves from real or delusional threats to their underlying self‐concept. However, the research to date has been inconsistent thereby limiting the conclusion that can be inferred. A possible explanation for these discrepant findings may be due to the use of measures with questionable validity and reliability such as the Attributional Style Questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Inventory. The present study aims to re‐examine this theory using an improved methodology to determine whether defensive functioning is a defining feature of persecutory delusions. Design and methods. Thirty‐five participants suffering from recent onset psychosis were assessed in a cross‐sectional design. Three tests of attributional style were used, two overt measures (Attributional Style Questionnaire, ASQ; and the Internal Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire, IPSAQ) and one covert measure (Pragmatic Inference Test). Self‐esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Inventory (SEI) and a semi‐structured interview (Self‐Evaluation and Social Support interview – schizophrenia version). Results. A self‐serving bias (SSB) was found in the total sample using the ASQ but not specifically in participants with persecutory delusions. In addition, the SSB was unrelated to levels of paranoia on any measure of attributional style. An underlying depressive attributional style was found in both subjects with and without persecutory delusions, but was not associated with levels of paranoia. Lower positive and higher negative self‐esteem was associated with increased paranoia and was associated with a SSB. Conclusion. The results indicate that the attributional biases observed in individuals with persecutory delusions are not symptom‐specific as previously suggested.

Causal attributions that occurred in these protocols were later coded as relationship-positive attributions or relationship-negative attributions. Causal judgments were also later directly elicited for each behavior on eight causal dimensions. Replicating previous research, results from both the spontaneous attribution probe and the causal scales suggested that happy partners produce attributions that enhance relationship quality, whereas unhappy partners produce attributions that maintain their current levels of distress.

In general, support was found for attributional egotism, but outcome was found to have a larger effect for informational (e.g., ""How hard did you try?"") as opposed to the more traditional causal (e.g., ""How much was effort a cause of your success?"") wording of the attribution questions.

What represents “style” in authorship attribution?,2018,,20,"Authorship attribution typically uses all information representing both content and style whereas attribution based only on stylistic aspects may be robust in cross-domain settings. This paper analyzes different linguistic aspects that may help represent style. Specifically, we study the role of syntax and lexical words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) in representing style. We use a purely syntactic language model to study the significance of sentence structures in both single-domain and cross-domain attribution, i.e. cross-topic and cross-genre attribution. We show that syntax may be helpful for cross-genre attribution while cross-topic attribution and single-domain may benefit from additional lexical information. Further, pure syntactic models may not be effective by themselves and need to be used in combination with other robust models. To study the role of word choice, we perform attribution by masking all words or specific topic words corresponding to nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Using a single-domain dataset, IMDB1M reviews, we demonstrate the heavy influence of common nouns and proper nouns in attribution, thereby highlighting topic interference. Using cross-domain Guardian10 dataset, we show that some common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs may help with stylometric attribution as demonstrated by masking topic words corresponding to these parts-of-speech. As expected, it was observed that proper nouns are heavily influenced by content and cross-domain attribution will benefit from completely masking them.","['Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Noun', 'Natural language processing', 'Syntax', 'Sentence', 'Domain (mathematical analysis)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Linguistics', 'Part of speech', 'Psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Social psychology', 'Archaeology', 'History']","['Kalaivani Sundararajan', 'Damon L.

A balanced measure of attributional style,1984,https://doi.org/10.1080/00049538408255096,33,"A New measure of attributional style, the Balanced Attributional Style Questionnaire (BASQ), is described in which the positive and negative items are matched for content. The BASQ requires subjects to write down the major cause for each of eight good events and eight bad events, equally divided into achievement and affiliation situations. Subscale scores can be obtained for the rated internality, stability, and globality of the reported causes and for the importance of the situations, and composite measures of attributional style can also be derived. These scores are shown to have respectable psychometric properties (inter-item reliability, test-reliability, validity) encouraging further use and development of the BASQ in a variety of settings.","['Globality', 'Psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Test (biology)', 'Social psychology', 'Measure (data warehouse)', 'Variety (cybernetics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Statistics', 'Paleontology', 'Power (physics)', 'Physics', 'Archaeology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Database', 'Biology', 'Computer science', 'Economics', 'Market economy', 'Globalization', 'History', 'Mathematics']","['N.

"Locus of Control, Attributional style, and Academic Achievement: Comparative Analysis of Korean‐Chinese, and Chinese Students",1998,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-839x.00013,54,"The authors conducted two studies to examine the relationship between attributional style, locus of control, and academic achievement. Using the scales developed by the first author (Park, 1995), the first study compared the attributional style and locus of control of honor students (those who received scholarship) with those who were on academic probation. The results indicated that compared to students on academic probation, honor students were more likely to score higher on internal locus of control and lower on external locus of control. They were more likely to attribute their success to effort and the influence of other people. For failure, the honor students were less likely to attribute their failure to a lack of ability and lack of support from significant others. The second study examined the relationship between the locus of control and academic achievement among three samples: Korean, Korean‐Chinese, and Chinese university students. A 40‐item locus of control questionnaire and background information section containing sex and self‐reported academic grade were administered. The results showed that the Korean sample had the highest internal locus of control score and the lowest external locus of control score. The Korean‐Chinese sample, in contrast, scored highest on external locus of control. These results are consistent with past research investigating the cultural influence upon the individual’s locus of control. Furthermore, as found in the first study, a significant relationship was found between locus of control and academic grade. For the Korean sample, students with higher academic grades scored higher on internality and lower on externality. For the Chinese sample, students with higher academic grades scored higher on internality. There were no significant differences for the Korean‐Chinese sample.

The way a person explains or attributes cause to events which occur influences these expectations. The symptoms of PTSD and helplessness behavior heavily overlap. The present study tested whether there was, in fact, a relationship between a proven measure of the attributional style proposed by helplessness theory, the Attributional Style Questionnaire, and measures of PTSD in a group of 99 patients seeking treatment for alcohol dependence and/or pathological gambling.

How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field.

The study patients were assessed using the symptom interpretation questionnaire, somatosensory amplification scale, and scales for assessing alexithymia and illness attitudes.The somatoform and depressive disorder patients had greater recent symptom experience than the normal group.

Twenty-five eating-disordered women and 26 nonclinical women each completed measures of attributional style, depressed mood, and eating pathology. They also completed a measure of verbal intelligence (to ensure comparability of groups). Women with an eating disorder had a greater tendency to attribute negative situations to the self when compared with nonclinical women, even when differences in depressed mood were controlled for. There were no comparable differences in positive attributional biases. Women with an eating disorder adopt a self-blaming style when evaluating negative events, and such self-blame is likely to contribute to the maintenance of an eating disorder.

These students completed the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS; Reynolds, 1987), the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ; Peterson et al., 1982), the Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire (CASQ; Seligman et al., 1984), the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS; Weissman, 1979), and rated themselves and were rated by their teachers regarding social competency. Multivariate analysis showed significant differences among the groups on these measures. Students with LD reported higher depressive symptomatology, displayed a more ""depressogenic"" attributional style, a more dysfunctional attitude, and rated themselves and were rated by their teachers as less socially competent than NSPED students. When the subgroups of LD and NSPED students were compared, the LD-US group differed significantly from the two NSPED groups more frequently than did the LD-S group. Additional multivariate analysis revealed that students who reported the most depressive symptoms differed from students who reported the least depressive symptoms on all measures. Results suggest that adolescent subgroups differ in self-reported depressive symptomatology, and support attributional, cognitive, and social learning competency theories of depression for adolescents.

It is not known whether this biased attributional style also characterizes individuals at clinical risk for psychosis or if it is associated with their emergent paranoia. Methods: Thirty‐three clinical high‐risk patients and 15 age‐ and gender‐similar controls were assessed with the Internal, Personal, and Situational Attributions Questionnaire for externalizing and personalizing attributional biases and for potential correlates with suspiciousness and other symptoms. Results: Both patients and controls had a similar external‐personalizing attributional style that was unrelated to symptoms, including suspiciousness. Conclusions: Consistent with other studies, a biased attributional style was not associated with subthreshold paranoia.

In addition, to test the mediation component of the theory, we examined whether the relation between the hypothesized attributional diathesis and failure students' subsequent depressive mood responses to their low midterm grades was mediated by the particular causal attributions these students made for their low grades.

Data from two panel studies suggest that causal attribution styles could in fact play a central role in the mediation of social causation of disorder.

Learned helplessness theory, which also derives from the experiments on inescapable shock, proposes that helplessness behavior in humans is the result of people's expectations about events which they perceive to be uncontrollable. The way a person explains or attributes cause to events which occur influences these expectations. The symptoms of PTSD and helplessness behavior heavily overlap. The present study tested whether there was, in fact, a relationship between a proven measure of the attributional style proposed by helplessness theory, the Attributional Style Questionnaire, and measures of PTSD in a group of 99 patients seeking treatment for alcohol dependence and/or pathological gambling. Consistent, significant relationships were found between learned helplessness attributional style and a variety of measures of PTSD.

They argue that the same behavior, bargaining assertively, is construed as congruent with female gender roles in some contexts yet incongruent in other contexts. Further, women take this contextual variation into account, adjusting their bargaining behavior to manage social impressions. A particularly important contextual variable is advocacy-whether bargaining on one's own behalf versus on another's behalf. In self-advocacy contexts, women anticipate that assertiveness will evoke incongruity evaluations, negative attributions, and subsequent ""backlash""; hence, women hedge their assertiveness, using fewer competing tactics and obtaining lower outcomes. However, in other-advocacy contexts, women achieve better outcomes as they do not expect incongruity evaluations or engage in hedging. In a controlled laboratory experiment, the authors found that gender interacts with advocacy context in this way to determine negotiation style and outcomes.

Two hundred and thirty‐four psychology students completed a questionnaire containing the Italian version of the Need for Closure scale, a measure of political and ideological attitudes, a measure of the person‐system blame dimensions, and a measure of past voting. Results showed that high NFC individuals (vs. low NFCs) reported having voted for a right‐wing party and holding more conservative attitudes. High NFCs (vs. low NFCs) turned out to have stronger anti‐immigrant attitudes, to be more nationalistic, to prefer an autocratic leadership and a centralized form of political power. High NFCs also value religiosity more highly than low NFCs. High NFCs (vs. low NFCs) scored lower on pluralism and multiculturalism. Furthermore, high NFCs (vs. low NFCs) revealed a tendency to blame individuals for social problems, but no significant difference was found with regard to the system blame dimension.

De-anonymizing programmers via code stylometry,2015,,142,"Source code authorship attribution is a significant privacy threat to anonymous code contributors. However, it may also enable attribution of successful attacks from code left behind on an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft, and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. In this work, we investigate machine learning methods to de-anonymize source code authors of C/C++ using coding style. Our Code Stylometry Feature Set is a novel representation of coding style found in source code that reflects coding style from properties derived from abstract syntax trees.

Our random forest and abstract syntax tree-based approach attributes more authors (1,600 and 250) with significantly higher accuracy (94% and 98%) on a larger data set (Google Code Jam) than has been previously achieved. Furthermore, these novel features are robust, difficult to obfuscate, and can be used in other programming languages, such as Python. We also find that (i) the code resulting from difficult programming tasks is easier to attribute than easier tasks and (ii) skilled programmers (who can complete the more difficult tasks) are easier to attribute than less skilled programmers.","['Computer science', 'Programming language', 'Abstract syntax tree', 'Source code', 'Python (programming language)', 'Stylometry', 'Abstract syntax', 'Coding (social sciences)', 'Syntax', 'Code (set theory)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Theoretical computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']","['Aylin Caliskan-Islam', 'Richard Harang', 'Andy Liu', 'Arvind Narayanan', 'Clare R.

Attributional style of children with and without Specific Learning Disability,2013,https://doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.31.13064,31,"Introduction. The literature highlights that pupils with Specific Learning Disability (SLD) often reveal a poor meta-cognitive system, with low levels of attribution to internal factors like diligence and personal skills, and high levels of attribution to external factors like ease of task, luck or help from others.Method. This study aims to analyze the attributions expressed in the school context by pupils diagnosed with Specific Learning Disability (N=38; Age in months: Mean=100.24; SD=5.828) and to compare them with those by children without learning disabilities (N=70; 38 of them with the same academic achievements as the pupils with SLD, and 32 with opposite achievement levels). The instruments are the Attribution Test 4-10 years, nationally validated learning tests and the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale.Results. The analysis shows that just the pupils with SLD do not have an attributive style of the “strategic effort” kind, and, among them, the children that obtain the best scores in the nationally validated learning tests are the ones who least often, especially in cases of success, choose the ability factor and most often choose luck as the cause. Considering the teachers’ perceptions of the relationship between the pupils in the sample, the most significant score is related to Dependency: children with SLD are perceived far more dependent than their mates without SLD.Discussion and Conclusion. Results show that SLD do not cause a disadaptive attributive style but it causes an higher level of Dependency on the teacher; these children, in fact, do not have such a strong, stable attributive style with internal locus, and are inclined to attribute their results also to factors outside their own person. As a result, they seem not aware of their potential and search help even when it is not necessary.","['Attribution', 'Luck', 'Psychology', 'Learning disability', 'Attributive', 'Developmental psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Blame', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Perception', 'Task (project management)', 'Test (biology)', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Linguistics', 'Paleontology', 'History', 'Theology', 'Archaeology', 'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Management', 'Economics']","['Tiziana Pasta', 'Manuela Mendola', 'Claudio Longobardi', 'Laura Elvira Prino', 'Francesca Giovanna Maria Gastaldi']",31,True,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,[]
Attributional Style as a Mediator Between Parental Abuse Risk and Child Internalizing Symptomatology,2006,https://doi.org/10.1177/1077559505285743,34,"This study examined a model wherein children's attributional style mediates the relationship between parental physical child-abuse risk and children's internalizing problems. Using structural equation modeling, three indices of abuse risk were selected (child abuse potential, physical discipline use, and dysfunctional parenting style) and two indices of children's internalizing problems (depression and anxiety). The sample included 75 parent-child dyads, in which parents reported on their abuse risk and children independently completed measures of depressive and anxious symptomatology and a measure on their attributional style. Findings supported the model that children's attributional style for positive events (but not negative events) partially mediated the relationship between abuse risk and internalizing symptoms, with significant direct and indirect effects of abuse risk on internalizing symptomatology.

Attributional Style, Depressed Mood, and Persecutory Delusions in Patients With Schizophrenia",2014,https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbu040,54,"Theoretical models postulate an important role of attributional style (AS) in the formation and maintenance of persecutory delusions and other positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, current research has gathered conflicting findings. In a cross-sectional design, patients with persistent positive symptoms of schizophrenia (n = 258) and healthy controls (n = 51) completed a revised version of the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ-R) and assessments of psychopathology. In comparison to controls, neither patients with schizophrenia in general nor patients with persecutory delusions (n = 142) in particular presented an externalizing and personalizing AS. Rather, both groups showed a ""self-blaming"" AS and attributed negative events more toward themselves. Persecutory delusions were independently predicted by a personalizing bias for negative events (beta = 0.197, P = .001) and by depression (beta = 0.152, P = .013), but only 5% of the variance in persecutory delusions could be explained. Cluster analysis of IPSAQ-R scores identified a ""personalizing"" (n = 70) and a ""self-blaming"" subgroup (n = 188), with the former showing slightly more pronounced persecutory delusions (P = .021). Results indicate that patients with schizophrenia and patients with persecutory delusions both mostly blamed themselves for negative events. Nevertheless, still a subgroup of patients could be identified who presented a more pronounced personalizing bias and more severe persecutory delusions. Thus, AS in patients with schizophrenia might be less stable but more determined by individual and situational characteristics that need further elucidation.","['Psychology', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Psychopathology', 'Attribution', 'Mood', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Association (psychology)', 'Paranoia', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social psychology']","['Stephanie Mehl', 'Manfred Landsberg', 'Anna-Christine Schmidt', 'Maurice Cabanis', 'Andreas Bechdolf', 'Jutta Herrlich', 'Stephanie Loos-Jankowiak', 'Tilo Kircher', 'S.

Corpus-based grammatical and pragmatic analyses of literary language are also briefly considered. Then, in the concluding part of the paper, I briefly survey earlier computational and statistical research on authorship attribution and literary style.

Using as testing ground a part of the Wall Street Journal corpus, we show that the most frequent words of the British National Corpus, representing the most frequent words of the written English language, are more reliable discriminators of text genre in comparison to the most frequent words of the training corpus.

Continuation cognitive-behavioural therapy maintains attributional style improvement in depressed patients responding acutely to fluoxetine,2004,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291703001028,34,"Background. Little is known about how continuation and maintenance cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) influences important psychological constructs that may be associated with long-term outcome of major depressive disorder. The goal of this study was to examine whether CBT would help maintain attributional style changes experienced by patients during acute phase fluoxetine treatment. Method. Three hundred and ninety-one patients with major depressive disorder were enrolled in an open, fixed-dose 8 week fluoxetine trial. Remitters to this acute phase treatment ( N =132) were randomized to receive either fixed-dose fluoxetine (meds only) or fixed-dose fluoxetine plus cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT+meds) during a 6-month continuation treatment phase. The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) was completed by patients at three time points – acute phase baseline, continuation phase baseline and continuation phase endpoint. Analysis of covariance was used to compare continuation phase ASQ composite score changes between groups. Results. Patients in both treatment groups experienced significant gains in positive attributional style during the acute phase of treatment. Continuation phase ASQ composite change scores differed significantly between treatment groups, with the CBT+meds group maintaining acute phase positive attributional style changes, and the meds only group exhibiting a worsening of attributional style. The two treatment groups did not significantly differ in rates of relapse and final continuation phase visit HAMD-17 scores. Conclusions. In this sample, the addition of CBT to continuation psychopharmacological treatment was associated with maintenance of acute treatment phase attributional style gains. Further research is needed to evaluate the role of such gains in the long-term course of depressive illness.","['Fluoxetine', 'Continuation', 'Psychology', 'Randomized controlled trial', 'Cognition', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Major depressive disorder', 'Medicine', 'Internal medicine', 'Receptor', 'Computer science', 'Serotonin', 'Programming language']","['Thor Petersen', 'Rebecca Harley', 'George I.

Given its importance, it is fundamental for management to be able to foster trust and thus necessary to accurately diagnose the current state of trust in their organization. However, diagnosing trust in real contexts is challenging due to its taboo and tacit nature. Hence, a surreptitious approach to data gathering and analysis may be required to elicit honest accounts from participants about trust. This paper contends that attribution theory can provide the basis for the development of such an analytical framework by enabling researchers to analyse field data about organizational life. The paper presents literature that highlights the appropriateness of attribution style analysis for explaining trust. It presents a taxonomy of trust‐related terms, and proposes a framework of distinct attribution patterns for each term to systematize the diagnosis of trust in situ . The paper concludes with a discussion about the value of the framework for trust research and directions for future work.","['Attribution', 'Taboo', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Knowledge management', 'Taxonomy (biology)', 'Computer science', 'Public relations', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Social psychology', 'Political science', 'Botany', 'Mathematics', 'Anthropology', 'Pure mathematics', 'Biology']",['Tally Hatzakis'],69,False,British Journal of Management,[]
"What mediates the link between childhood maltreatment and depression? The role of emotion dysregulation, attachment, and attributional style",2016,https://doi.org/10.3402/ejpt.v7.32652,45,"Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been shown to be related to a severe and/or chronic course of depression. This study investigated which psychological processes mediate this relationship.A large sample of acute or recovered depressed individuals (N=340) participated in an online survey assessing characteristics of depression, trauma exposure, and potential mediators (emotion regulation difficulties, attributional style, and attachment).The experience of CM was related to more severe depression and more depressive episodes. In multiple mediation models, emotion dysregulation, a depressogenic attributional style, and avoidance in close relationships conjointly mediated the relationship between CM and depression severity as well as number of depressive episodes. However, a significant direct path between CM and depression characteristics remained. Exploratory analyses suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity was an important additional mediator in our sample.Our findings provide preliminary evidence for psychological mediators between CM and depression that may be promising targets for interventions tailored for the treatment of depression in this subgroup.","['Depression (economics)', 'Psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Mediation', 'Psychological intervention', 'Attachment theory', 'Emotional dysregulation', 'Insecure attachment', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Path analysis (statistics)', 'Poison control', 'Suicide prevention', 'Psychiatry', 'Medicine', 'Anxiety', 'Environmental health', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']","['Anna Schierholz', 'Antje Krüger', 'Jens Barenbrügge', 'Thomas Ehring']",45,True,European journal of psychotraumatology,[]

In this study, 260 subjects were identified as physically abused, psychologically abused, both physically and psychologically abused, or nonabused, based on responses to the Child Abuse Questionnaire (CAQ). Subjects were tested for levels of nonclinical depression via the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), for levels of self-esteem via the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), and for the adaptiveness of attributional style via the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ). It was hypothesized that each of the three abuse groups would differ from the control group on the three dependent measures; differences among the three abuse groups were also explored. Three one-way analyses of variance indicated that (1) BDI scores reflected a greater tendency toward depression in subjects reporting both types of abuse than in nonabused subjects or in subjects reporting either psychological or physical abuse, (2) subjects reporting psychological abuse only or both psychological and physical abuse showed lower self-esteem than did nonabused subjects, and (3) abused subjects did not seem to exhibit a more maladaptive attributional style than that of nonabused subjects. In addition, multiple linear regression analyses pointed to psychological abuse as a critical variable in predicting levels of depression, self-esteem, and attributional style, when physical abuse effects were controlled.

Study 2 replicated unexpected findings from study 1. Study 3 evaluated whether pregnant teenagers with a pessimistic attributional style will be more depressed after childbirth than optimistic pregnant teenagers. Method: In study 1, 122 pregnant and 96 nonpregnant teenagers completed questionnaires assessing depression and attributional style. In study 2, 43 pregnant teenagers and 49 nonpregnant teenagers completed the same questionnaires. In study 3, subjects from studies 1 and 2 were contacted by mail and asked to complete the same questionnaires; 63 (38%) did so.Results: In studies 1 and 2, pregnant teenagers with a pessimistic attributional style were less depressed than those with an optimistic attributional style and the nonpregnant group. In study 3, pessimistic teenagers experienced a higher level of depression than nonpessimistic adolescents following childbirth.Conclusions: Pregnancy may serve to protect pessimistic teenagers from experiencing depression. The subsequent demands of motherhood may remove any protection from depression afforded by the pregnancy.

Authorship Attribution Through Function Word Adjacency Networks,2015,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2015.2451111,81,"A method for authorship attribution based on function word adjacency networks (WANs) is introduced. Function words are parts of speech that express grammatical relationships between other words but do not carry lexical meaning on their own. In the WANs in this paper, nodes are function words and directed edges from a source function word to a target function word stand in for the likelihood of finding the latter in the ordered vicinity of the former. WANs of different authors can be interpreted as transition probabilities of a Markov chain and are therefore compared in terms of their relative entropies. Optimal selection of WAN parameters is studied and attribution accuracy is benchmarked across a diverse pool of authors and varying text lengths. This analysis shows that, since function words are independent of content, their use tends to be specific to an author and that the relational data captured by function WANs is a good summary of stylometric fingerprints. Attribution accuracy is observed to exceed the one achieved by methods that rely on word frequencies alone. Further combining WANs with methods that rely on word frequencies, results in larger attribution accuracy, indicating that both sources of information encode different aspects of authorial styles.","['Computer science', 'Adjacency list', 'Word (group theory)', 'Natural language processing', 'Attribution', 'Function (biology)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Markov chain', 'Part of speech', 'Speech recognition', 'Mathematics', 'Algorithm', 'Machine learning', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Biology', 'Geometry', 'Evolutionary biology']","['Santiago Segarra', 'Mark Eisen', 'Alejandro Ribeiro']",61,False,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,[]
"Style, Statistics, and New Models of Authorship[1]",2009,,68,"I1. In this essay I argue that humanities computing can change ideas about the role authors play within texts and can offer a path to a new conception of authorship. My focus is on computational stylistics in particular. The results of this practice tell us on a statistical basis that texts reflect the styles of their authors to a remarkable, perhaps unsuspected, extent. The results do not support the idea that authors are insignificant as sources of meaning, but neither do they license a return to an older idea of sovereign, hegemonic authors, as I hope to show. The findings of computational stylistics can serve to test theories about authorship and in turn to suggest modifications to those theories.2. The link between theory and evidence has already been made by some commentators on authorship influenced by postmodernism. They make a wager: they believe that a certain theory about texts, which they hold to be valid, rules that attribution studies cannot work. They predict that empirical methods for attribution will necessarily be defeated by the variation within an authorial canon, and by competing commonalities between texts. Computational stylistics, taking up this challenge, can show that these predictions are false. This in turn suggests that the theory on which the predictions were made is inadequate. A new theory is needed which fits the new evidence.3. Putting it at its most grandiose we can say that with computational stylistics we can for the first time make a genuine connection between generalisation and detailed evidence about style. In the case of authorship, statistical studies might have revealed - were free to reveal - that authorship is insignificant in comparison to other factors like genre or period. In that case the theory that authors are only secondary to other forces in textual patterning would have been validated.

A PDTB-styled end-to-end discourse parser,2012,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1351324912000307,280,"Abstract Since the release of the large discourse-level annotation of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), research work has been carried out on certain subtasks of this annotation, such as disambiguating discourse connectives and classifying Explicit or Implicit relations. We see a need to construct a full parser on top of these subtasks and propose a way to evaluate the parser. In this work, we have designed and developed an end-to-end discourse parser-to-parse free texts in the PDTB style in a fully data-driven approach. The parser consists of multiple components joined in a sequential pipeline architecture, which includes a connective classifier, argument labeler, explicit classifier, non-explicit classifier, and attribution span labeler. Our trained parser first identifies all discourse and non-discourse relations, locates and labels their arguments, and then classifies the sense of the relation between each pair of arguments. For the identified relations, the parser also determines the attribution spans, if any, associated with them. We introduce novel approaches to locate and label arguments, and to identify attribution spans. We also significantly improve on the current state-of-the-art connective classifier. We propose and present a comprehensive evaluation from both component-wise and error-cascading perspectives, in which we illustrate how each component performs in isolation, as well as how the pipeline performs with errors propagated forward. The parser gives an overall system F 1 score of 46.80 percent for partial matching utilizing gold standard parses, and 38.18 percent with full automation.","['Computer science', 'Parsing', 'Treebank', 'Natural language processing', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Pipeline (software)', 'Annotation', 'Sentence', 'Programming language']","['Ziheng Lin', 'Hwee Tou Ng', 'Min‐Yen Kan']",62,False,Natural Language Engineering,[]

A second set of mood and cognitive measures was administered afterwards. Results showed that a stronger positive relationship between negative attributional style and level of depressive symptoms was found in the analytical self-focus condition, relative to the experiential and distraction conditions.

Although these studies suggest a connection between hardiness and health, they do not provide evidence of specific mediators of this effect.

Specifically, it was predicted that compared to nonhardy individuals, hardy individuals would be more likely to make internal, stable, global attributions for positive events and external, unstable, specific attributions for negative events. In addition, it was predicted that this pattern would be most characteristic of the hardiness subcomponents of commitment and control. The pattern of attributions for the subcomponent of commitment provided strong support for the predictions. Similar, but weaker, effects were found for the subcomponent of control.

A novel approach of mining write-prints for authorship attribution in e-mail forensics,2008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2008.05.001,129,"There is an alarming increase in the number of cybercrime incidents through anonymous e-mails. The problem of e-mail authorship attribution is to identify the most plausible author of an anonymous e-mail from a group of potential suspects. Most previous contributions employed a traditional classification approach, such as decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the author and studied the effects of different writing style features on the classification accuracy. However, little attention has been given on ensuring the quality of the evidence. In this paper, we introduce an innovative data mining method to capture the write-print of every suspect and model it as combinations of features that occurred frequently in the suspect's e-mails. This notion is called frequent pattern, which has proven to be effective in many data mining applications, but it is the first time to be applied to the problem of authorship attribution. Unlike the traditional approach, the extracted write-print by our method is unique among the suspects and, therefore, provides convincing and credible evidence for presenting it in a court of law. Experiments on real-life e-mails suggest that the proposed method can effectively identify the author and the results are supported by a strong evidence.","['Authorship attribution', 'Suspect', 'Computer science', 'Attribution', 'Decision tree', 'Support vector machine', 'Quality (philosophy)', 'Information retrieval', 'Data mining', 'Data science', 'Computer security', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Criminology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology']","['Farkhund Iqbal', 'Rachid Hadjidj', 'Benjamin C.

Personality Correlates of Attributional Style,1989,https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.1989.10542999,17,"ABSTRACT Previous research, much of it based on the learned helplessness model of depression, suggested that a wide variety of personality variables might be related to attributional style. The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ; Peterson et al., 1982) and Comrey Personality Scales (CPS; Comrey, 1970) were administered to 329 subjects, and their scores were subjected to correlational and multiple regression analysis. The CPS scales were also factor analyzed, and the resulting scores were correlated with ASQ scores. Results indicated that a variety of personality variables have statistically significant relationships with attributional style, that these variables show significant positive relationships with internal, stable, and global attributions for positive events and significant negative relationships with these same attributions for negative events, and that an Activity—Extraversion—Stability factor demonstrates the strongest relationships with attributional style. Findings are interpreted within a revised theoretical framework, and emphasis is placed on understanding the personality correlates of attributional style for adequate interpretation of the concept.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Extraversion and introversion', 'Personality', 'Learned helplessness', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'History', 'Archaeology']",['James V.

The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ): A new measure for evaluating hostile social-cognitive biases in paranoia,2007,https://doi.org/10.1080/13546800600787854,339,"Introduction. This study reports on the development of a new measure of hostile social-cognitive biases for use in paranoia research, the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ). The AIHQ is comprised of a variety of negative situations that differ in terms of intentionality. Items were developed to reflect causes that were ambiguous, intentional, and accidental in nature. Methods. Participants were 322 college students who completed the AIHQ along with measures of paranoia, hostility, attributional style, and psychosis proneness. The reliability and validity of the AIHQ was evaluated using both correlational and multiple regression methods. Results. The AIHQ had good levels of reliability (internal consistency and interrater reliability). The AIHQ was positively correlated with paranoia and hostility and was not correlated with measures of psychosis proneness, which supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale. In addition, the AIHQ predicted incremental variance in paranoia scores as compared to the attributional, hostility, and psychosis proneness measures. Ambiguous items showed the most consistent relationships with paranoia. Conclusions. The AIHQ appears to be a reliable and valid measure of hostile social cognitive biases in paranoia. Recommendations for using the AIHQ in the study of paranoia are discussed.","['Paranoia', 'Hostility', 'Psychology', 'Convergent validity', 'Psychosis', 'Discriminant validity', 'Cognition', 'Social cognition', 'Delusion', 'Test validity', 'Attribution bias', 'Psychometrics', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Internal consistency']","['Dennis R.

How Stigmatising Is Schizophrenia in India?,2000,https://doi.org/10.1177/002076400004600206,221,"Stigma is a social devaluation of a person because of personal attribute leading to an experience of sense of shame, disgrace and social isolation. The nature of stigma in schizophrenia and its relationship to attribution was studied in one hundred and fifty-nine urban patients of Madras, India who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The response of the primary care givers to fourteen questions on stigma and 14 on what they thought attributed to the illness was elicited. Based on the mean stigma score, the entire sample was divided into two groups- those with high and low stigma. Marriage, fear of rejection by neighbour, and the need to hide the fact from others were some of the more stigmatising aspects. Many care givers reported feelings of depression and sorrow. Discriminant function analysis showed that female sex of the patient and a younger age of both patient and caregiver were related to higher stigma.

"Regulatory Styles, Causal Attributions and Academic Achievement",2009,https://doi.org/10.1177/0143034309106946,24,"In the past few decades a growing research interest in internal and external factors that contribute to a student’s motivation to learn has yielded numerous models and theories. Despite their similarities, these theories have tended to be developed and tested independently of each other, although some connections have been made between them. The aim of this study is to investigate connections between key aspects of two theoretical approaches: the attributional theory (Weiner, 1985, 1992) and self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 2000). Specifically, this study investigates the relationship between four types of regulatory styles of learning and students’ causal attributions of their attained academic achievement. The participants were 127 elementary school students (M age = 13.71) in Croatia. First, students assessed their final mid-term grades either as success or failure (subjective appraisal of successfulness), after which the Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire of Ryan and Connell (1989) and the Causal Attribution Scale of Sorić (1998) were applied. The results showed that intrinsically motivated successful students, who feel autonomous and self-determined rather than controlled by others, attributed their success to more internal and controllable causes. But associations between other regulatory styles and causal dimensions still remain unclear, especially in the case of failure situations.","['Attribution', 'Deci-', 'Psychology', 'Academic achievement', 'Social psychology', 'Causal model', 'Need for achievement', 'Scale (ratio)', 'Causality (physics)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Autonomy', 'Medicine', 'Pathology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics']",['Izabela Sorić'],20,False,School Psychology International,[]
A Prospective Test of the Hopelessness Theory of Depression in Children,2006,https://doi.org/10.1207/s15374424jccp3502_10,161,"Abstract Providing a developmental extension of the cognitive theories of depression, researchers and theorists (e.g., Cole & Turner, 1993; Rose & Abramson, 1992) have suggested that during early to middle childhood, attributional styles may mediate rather than moderate the association between negative life events and the development of depression. Within the context of the hopelessness theory of depression (e.g., Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989), we tested this hypothesis in a 6-month longitudinal study of 4th- and 5th-grade children. Using path analysis, we found support for the mediating role of attributional styles among both 4th and 5th graders. Supporting recent refinements in the hopelessness theory, the best fitting mediation model was one in which depressive symptoms exhibited reciprocal relations with the other variables. Specifically, attributional styles partially mediated the link between verbal victimization and residual change in depressive symptoms. In addition, initial depressive symptoms predicted negative changes in children's attributional styles and increases in verbal victimization across the follow-up. Contrary to our hypothesis, we also found support for the moderating role of attributional styles, although this was significant only among 5th graders.","['Psychology', 'Mediation', 'Developmental psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Depression (economics)', 'Attribution', 'Path analysis (statistics)', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Association (psychology)', 'Moderated mediation', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognition', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Paleontology', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Macroeconomics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Brandon E.

Attributional style and its relation to other personality dispositions,1998,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8279.1998.tb01310.x,18,"Background . People vary greatly with respect to the way they explain negative events (personal failures), and this variation in attributional style seems to be related to various personality traits and also academic performance. For example, the theory of learned helplessness regards a pessimistic attributional style as an important determinant in the development of depression. Aim . The primary purpose of the present study was to compare attributions for positive and negative events with respect to correlations with seven personality dispositions. The comparisons concern the three attributional dimensions internality, stability and globality, as well as their combination. The hypothesis was that attributions for positive events are differently correlated with the seven personality dispositions than are attributions for negative events. Sample . 166 advanced teacher students (132 females and 34 males). Method . On the basis of an inventory the students were given scores on the attributional variables (related to imagined positive and negative academic events), global and academic self‐esteem, motive to seek success, motive to avoid failure, self‐efficacy, defensiveness, and depression. Results . The hypothesis was confirmed. Attributions for positive events correlated differently with the seven personality dispositions than attributions for negative events. Also, factor analysis of the attributional dimensions indicated that attributions for positive events measured quite different components than attributions for positive events. Conclusion . The general conclusion is that both event kinds should be considered when using attributional style for predicting or explaining personality and behavioural variables.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Personality', 'Learned helplessness', 'Pessimism', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'Epistemology', 'History']","['Richard Haugen', 'Thorleif Lund']",0,False,British Journal of Educational Psychology,[]

Cluster analyses of collocations over various spans, types, and linkages are performed on groups of texts by known authors to determine how well the frequencies of those collocations correctly attribute the texts to their authors and distinguish them from texts by other authors. In each case the results are compared with those based on the frequencies of frequent words and the frequencies of frequent sequences of words. Cluster analyses based on frequent words and sequences ascribe many of the texts to their correct authors. However, analyses based on frequent collocations are more accurate for several groups of texts, sometimes producing more completely correct attributions than analyses based on either words or sequences and sometimes producing the only completely correct attributions. They also produce results for small groups of problematic novels and critical texts extracted from the larger corpora that are often superior to those based on frequent words or frequent sequences. Finally, they perform better than analyses based on frequent words or sequences in simulated authorship attribution scenarios. Cluster analysis based on frequent collocations provides a robust and effective method of authorship attribution.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Art', 'Literature', 'Philosophy']",['David L.

Three distinct domains, Twitter feeds, blog entries, and Reddit comments, are explored in this work. We determine that state-of-the-art methods in stylometry do not perform as well in cross-domain situations (34.3% accuracy) as they do in in-domain situations (83.5% accuracy) and propose methods that improve performance in the cross-domain setting with both feature and classification level techniques which can increase accuracy to up to 70%. In addition to testing these approaches on a large real world dataset, we also examine real world adversarial cases where an author is actively attempting to hide their identity. Being able to identify authors across domains facilitates linking identities across the Internet making this a key security and privacy concern; users can take other measures to ensure their anonymity, but due to their unique writing style, they may not be as anonymous as they believe.","['Stylometry', 'Suspect', 'Authorship attribution', 'Computer science', 'Domain (mathematical analysis)', 'Anonymity', 'Adversarial system', 'Attribution', 'Social media', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'The Internet', 'Identity (music)', 'Writing style', 'Data science', 'Key (lock)', 'Information retrieval', 'Internet privacy', 'World Wide Web', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer security', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Criminology', 'Acoustics', 'Programming language']","['Rebekah Overdorf', 'Rachel Greenstadt']",29,True,Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,[]

The experimental group were Down's syndrome adolescents. Participants in the first control group were matched to the experimental groups for mental age, and those in the second for chronological age. All of the 30 participants were given an attribution test consisting of 14 items, illustrative of everyday or school‐related events in which the main character experienced either success or failure. The participants were asked to attribute the character's performance to one of five causes: ability, effort, help, luck or task difficulty. The results show that adolescents with Down's syndrome tend to attribute performance to external help.

The findings lend support to the idea of establishing programmes that ""induce appropriate attributions"" in children and train teachers to become aware of the attributional process in order to effectively deal with discipline problems in school.

"Relations among Autonomy, Attribution Style, and Happiness in College Students.",2013,,34,"Research suggests that a personal sense of autonomy supports individuals' success in a variety of domains, but information regarding these processes remains unclear. This paper attempts to establish a link between personal autonomy and cognitive processes, in the form of attributions for success and failure, in establishing a sense of subjective well-being, or happiness. One hundred and forty-one, primarily white (57%), college students (69% female) ranging in age from 17-27 (M = 18.8) responded to a series of questionnaires. Using bootstrapping analysis, autonomy was revealed to mediate attribution styles related to happiness, CI = .05-.31; the reverse was also true, CI = .14-.86, suggesting that these two processes are bidirectional. It may be that happiness relies, at least in part, on both a sense of control and a positive explanatory style for events in one's life. Keywords: autonomy, happiness, subjective well-being, attribution style, emerging adulthood. ********** Happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), has become a hot topic of research in recent years, particularly since the emergence of positive psychology. Two major schools of thought coexist: those who either believe happiness to be primarily affectively based (hedonic, e.g., I feel happy) and those who believe it to be primarily cognitively based (e.g., I am happy with my life; Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). A third school, based in part on Headey and Wearing's (1989) dynamic equilibrium model, focuses on the interplay of cognitive processes regarding life events and affect in determining one's SWB. While no definitive definition exists, there is a general consensus that happiness is a balance of positive and negative affect, positive judgment about one's life satisfaction, and a sense of harmony (Chekola, 2007; Fave, Brdar, Freire, Vella-Brodrick, & Wissing, 2011; Headey & Wearing, 1989; Linley, Maltby, Wood, Osborn, & Hurling, 2009).

"ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT STYLE AND EGO IDENTITY, ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE, AND FAMILY OF ORIGIN IN FIRST-YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS",1999,,37,"This study examined the relationship between adult romantic attachment style and measures of cognitive attributional style, ego identity, attachment to primary caregiver, and family environment. Individuals having a secure attachment style were less likely to have a depressive attributional style and were more likely to have achieved ego identity status, to rate their primary caregivers as higher in independence-encouragement, and to rate their families as higher in expressiveness, cohesiveness, active-recreational orientation, and intellectual-cultural orientation than were individuals having a dismissive, fearful, or preoccupied attachment style. Fearful and preoccupied attachment styles were somewhat predictive of other measures of well-being, but dismissive scores were least related to other personality measures. Developmental research has consistently found that a secure infant attachment to primary caregiver has predicted inter- and intrapersonal competence and well-being later on (e.g., Arend, Gove, & Sroufe, 1978; Bretherton, 1985). Research over the past decade in social psychology has supported the proposition that Bowlby's (1982) ethological theory of mother-infant attachment may provide a basis for understanding the development of romantic relationships in adulthood as well (Brennan & Shaver, 1995). Bowlby's (1988) working model of attachment relations suggests that expectations developed in infancy through interactions with caregivers affect one's expectations about what social support can be expected from a romantic partner later on. Results of studies examining correlates of secure attachment in adulthood have generally been in the expected direction and parallel the infant findings that security in attachment is related to positive inter- and intrapersonal outcomes. For example, romantic love attachment style in young adulthood has been found to be related to such concurrent measures as the Big Five personality traits (Shaver & Brennen, 1992), self-c","['Psychology', 'Attachment theory', 'Developmental psychology', 'Intrapersonal communication', 'Social psychology', 'Romance', 'Personality', 'Cognitive style', 'Interpersonal communication', 'Cognition', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychoanalysis']",['Janice H.

ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE MODERATES THE IMPACT OF CAUSAL CONTROLLABILITY INFORMATION ON HELPING BEHAVIOR,1999,https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.1999.27.3.221,20,"The helping behavior of individuals with supportive (i.e., the tendency to view others' misfortunes as uncontrollable by the targets) and unsupportive (i.e., the tendency to view others' misfortunes as controllable by the targets) attributional styles was investigated in a natural setting, under conditions of high and low controllability of a target's need. Helping behavior was a function of the perceived controllability of the target's need for help and the helper's attributional style. While non-negligent targets were helped more than the negligent – supporting an attributional model of helping behavior (B. Weiner, 1980a, 1995) – the attributional style of potential helpers moderated that effect. Individuals with a supportive style helped a needy peer at the same rate irrespective of the controllability of the need. In contrast, unsupportive style individuals were very kind to the needy peer if the reason was legitimate, and highly neglectful if the peer was negligent. Thus, the causal structure of the situation was more influential in determining the behavior of unsupportive than supportive style respondents. The finding that attributional styles moderated helping reactions demonstrates that the attributional model of helping behavior is incomplete and that person variables must be considered in tandem with situational variables in attributional models of social behavior.","['Psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social psychology', 'Helping behavior', 'Attribution', 'Controllability', 'Moderation', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology', 'Applied mathematics', 'History']","['Nancy Higgins', 'Joanne K.

Cognitive styles and future depressed mood in early adulthood: The importance of global attributions,2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2014.08.057,30,"Cognitive theories of depression suggest that beliefs of low self-worth and the tendency to attribute negative events to causes that are global (widespread rather than specific) and stable (will persist rather than change in the future) are associated with the development of depressed mood. Such theories are supported by evidence from prospective studies and have guided the development of successful treatment and prevention strategies such as CBT. However, the relative importance of different psychological constructs within cognitive theories is unknown. This is important to refine cognitive theories and develop more efficient prevention strategies.We used prospective data from over 3500 young adults from the Avon Longitudinal Study for Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort in the UK to investigate the association between cognitive style, measured by short forms of the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS) and Cognitive Styles Questionnaire-Short Form (CSQ-SF) at age 18, and future depressed mood at age 19. Structural equation modelling techniques were used to separate cognitive style constructs.Cognitive styles were associated with future depressed mood, independently of baseline mood, both as measured by the DAS-SF and the CSQ-SF. Of the different CSQ-SF constructs, only global attributions were associated with both baseline and future mood independently of other constructs.The study was subject to attrition and the follow-up was relatively short (10 months).The findings suggest that the tendency to attribute negative events specifically to global causes could be particularly important for depression. Reducing global attributions is potentially important in the prevention and treatment of depression.","['Psychology', 'Mood', 'Attribution', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Dysfunctional family', 'Cognitive style', 'Depression (economics)', 'Longitudinal study', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics', 'Pathology']","['Rebecca M.

A distinction is made between three kinds of functional optimism that depend either on attributional style, outcome expectancies, or personal agency.

The Social Cognition Psychometric Evaluation Study: Results of the Expert Survey and RAND Panel,2013,https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbt081,448,"Background: In schizophrenia, social cognition is strongly linked to functional outcome and is increasingly seen as a viable treatment target. The goal of the Social Cognition Psychometric Evaluation (SCOPE) study is to identify and improve the best existing measures of social cognition so they can be suitably applied in large-scale treatment studies. Initial phases of this project sought to (1) develop consensus on critical domains of social cognition and (2) identify the best existing measures of social cognition for use in treatment studies. Methods: Experts in social cognition were invited to nominate key domains of social cognition and the best measures of those domains. Nominations for measures were reduced according to set criteria, and all available psychometric information about these measures was summarized and provided to RAND panelists. Panelists rated the quality of each measure on multiple criteria, and diverging ratings were discussed at the in-person meeting to obtain consensus. Results: Expert surveys identified 4 core domains of social cognition—emotion processing, social perception, theory of mind/mental state attribution, and attributional style/bias. Using RAND panel consensus ratings, the following measures were selected for further evaluation: Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire, Bell Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task, Penn Emotion Recognition Test, Relationships Across Domains, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, The Awareness of Social Inferences Test, Hinting Task, and Trustworthiness Task. Discussion: While it was possible to establish consensus, only a limited amount of psychometric information is currently available for the candidate measures, which underscores the need for well-validated and standardized measures in this area.","['Social cognition', 'Psychology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Emotion perception', 'Social information processing', 'Theory of mind', 'Social perception', 'Perception', 'Psychiatry', 'Neuroscience']","['Amy E.

Local Histograms of Character N-grams for Authorship Attribution,2011,,107,"This paper proposes the use of local histograms (LH) over character n-grams for authorship attribution (AA). LHs are enriched histogram representations that preserve sequential information in documents; they have been successfully used for text categorization and document visualization using word histograms. In this work we explore the suitability of LHs over n-grams at the character-level for AA. We show that LHs are particularly helpful for AA, because they provide useful information for uncovering, to some extent, the writing style of authors. We report experimental results in AA data sets that confirm that LHs over character n-grams are more helpful for AA than the usual global histograms, yielding results far superior to state of the art approaches. We found that LHs are even more advantageous in challenging conditions, such as having imbalanced and small training sets. Our results motivate further research on the use of LHs for modeling the writing style of authors for related tasks, such as authorship verification and plagiarism detection.","['Character (mathematics)', 'Histogram', 'Categorization', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Writing style', 'Natural language processing', 'Text categorization', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Visualization', 'Word (group theory)', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Literature', 'Social psychology', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Geometry']","['Hugo Jair Escalante', 'Thamar Solorio', 'Manuel Montes-y-Gómez']",28,False,Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,[]
The interactive effect of positive and negative occupational attributional styles on job motivation,2005,https://doi.org/10.1080/13594320444000218,18,"Research on attributional style in the work setting has generated inconsistent results concerning the effect attributional styles for positive and negative events have on job motivation and performance. This study set out to examine whether attributional style for positive and for negative work-related events, and their interaction, are related to job motivation. One hundred and sixteen working adults completed questionnaires measuring positive and negative attributional styles, and job motivation. The findings showed that both positive and negative attributional styles, as well as their interaction, were predictors of job motivation. The interactive effect suggests that a negative attributional style is negatively related to job motivation in the absence, but not in the presence, of a positive attributional style. It was also found that employees who have stayed for a reasonably long time with an organization (more than 4 years) are particularly vulnerable to negative attributional style. These findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical framework of positive – negative asymmetry in evaluations. Implications concerning the measurement of occupational attributional style are presented, as well as practical applications for organizations.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social psychology', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Work motivation', 'Work (physics)', 'Mechanical engineering', 'Archaeology', 'Computer science', 'Engineering', 'History', 'Programming language']",['Athena Xenikou'],44,False,European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology,[]

These were compared with 20 matched normal controls and results from published studies of schizophrenics. Results DD subjects did not show abnormal levels of overt or covert depression or schizotypy. They showed high levels of dysfunctional attitudes ( P &lt; 0.0001), a distinctive attributional style ( P = 0.01), and increased attention to threat-related stimuli ( P = 0.01).

"The Relationship of Early Maladaptive Schemas, Attributional Styles and Learned Helplessness among Addicted and Non-Addicted Men.",2011,,28,"BACKGROUND Addiction is considered as one of the major problems in family and community in the world. According to cognitive view, organizing the experiences determines how to behave. Due to their importance in interpretation of special situations, cognitive schemas and attributional styles have a significant role in cognitive theories. The aim of this study was to compare early maladaptive schemas and attributional styles in addicts and non-addicts to recognize their role in addiction. METHODS In this causal-comparative study, 200 addicted and non-addicted men were randomly selected. Young early maladaptive schema and attributional styles questionnaires were used. Data analysis was performed by independent t-test, Pearson correlation and regression. FINDINGS The study population included 81 addicted and 90 non-addicted men. There were significant differences between early maladaptive schemas and attributional styles in the two groups of addicted and non-addicted men (P < 0.001). In addition, addicts had higher levels of learned helplessness. A direct relationship was found between learned helplessness and frequency of addiction treatments (r ═ 0.234, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Our study showed that addicts suffer from high levels of early maladaptive schemas. They had a more pessimistic attributional style. Moreover, addicts who developed higher levels of learned helplessness were less successful in addiction treatment and more likely to use drugs again after treatment. These issues show that addiction institutions and therapists have to pay attention to cognitive factors for addiction prevention.","['Learned helplessness', 'Addiction', 'Psychology', 'Schema (genetic algorithms)', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Pessimism', 'Attribution', 'Cognitive style', 'Population', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Environmental health', 'Epistemology', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science']","['Farhad Shaghaghy', 'Majid Saffarinia', 'Mohadeseh Iranpoor', 'Ali Soltanynejad']",0,False,Addiction and Health,[]

This task can be viewed as a single-label multi-class text categorization problem. Given that the style of a text can be represented as mere word frequencies selected in a language-independent method, suitable machine learning techniques able to deal with high dimensional feature spaces and sparse data can be directly applied to solve this problem. This paper focuses on classifier ensembles based on feature set subspacing. It is shown that an effective ensemble can be constructed using, exhaustive disjoint subspacing, a simple method producing many poor but diverse base classifiers. The simple model can be enhanced by a variation of the technique of cross-validated committees applied to the feature set. Experiments on two benchmark text corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method improving previously reported results and compare it to support vector machines, an alternative suitable machine learning approach to authorship attribution.","['Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Disjoint sets', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Text categorization', 'Support vector machine', 'Machine learning', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Word (group theory)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Combinatorics', 'Programming language']",['Efstathios Stamatatos'],35,False,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence Tools,[]

Thus, the current study examined these relationships in a sample of New Zealand children and evaluated the specificity of maladaptive attributional cognitions to depression. Sixty-nine New Zealand school children ages 8 to 14 responded to three self-report measures: Children's Depression Inventory, Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale-Revised, Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire. Scores on the measures were comparable in some respects with those previously reported in the literature. Both depression and anxiety scores were significantly correlated with attributional style. However, multiple regression analysis revealed that depression but not anxiety significantly predicted overall attributional style. Thus, anxiety was no longer significantly correlated with maladaptive explanatory style upon controlling for depression. Given the high comorbidity of anxiety and depression, the present results have implications for prior research finding maladaptive attributions in other forms of psychopathology without controlling for depression. Nearly two decades ago, cognitive theorists proposed the attributional reformulation of the learned helplessness model of depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978; Abramson, Metaisky, & Alloy, 1989). Since then a substantial body of research has amassed supporting the theorized link between attributional style and depression. Attributional or explanatory style refers to how individuals account for positive and negative events. The internal-external dimension of attributional style refers to whether an individual attributes causes of events to themselves or to some outside force.

Approximately 1 year later, participants were reassessed on all measures. Analyses supported A. T. Beck's (1976) theory of depression (at the level of a trend) but not the hopelessness theory of depression. Findings were suggestive of a threshold view of vulnerability to depression; for those who experienced negative life events, depressive onset was related to dysfunctional attitudes but only when dysfunctional attitudes exceeded a certain level (low = intermediate < high). For participants who scored either very high or very low on both dysfunctional attitudes and negative attributional style, nonsignificant findings were obtained.","['Dysfunctional family', 'Psychology', 'Diathesis', 'Psychopathology', 'Depression (economics)', 'Diathesis–stress model', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive vulnerability', 'Cognition', 'Psychiatry', 'Developmental psychology', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Medicine', 'Medical tourism', 'Tourism', 'Political science', 'Economics', 'Law', 'Immunology', 'Macroeconomics']","['Peter M.

OBA2: An Onion approach to Binary code Authorship Attribution,2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2014.03.012,70,"A critical aspect of malware forensics is authorship analysis. The successful outcome of such analysis is usually determined by the reverse engineer's skills and by the volume and complexity of the code under analysis. To assist reverse engineers in such a tedious and error-prone task, it is desirable to develop reliable and automated tools for supporting the practice of malware authorship attribution. In a recent work, machine learning was used to rank and select syntax-based features such as n-grams and flow graphs. The experimental results showed that the top ranked features were unique for each author, which was regarded as an evidence that those features capture the author's programming styles. In this paper, however, we show that the uniqueness of features does not necessarily correspond to authorship. Specifically, our analysis demonstrates that many ""unique"" features selected using this method are clearly unrelated to the authors' programming styles, for example, unique IDs or random but unique function names generated by the compiler; furthermore, the overall accuracy is generally unsatisfactory. Motivated by this discovery, we propose a layered Onion Approach for Binary Authorship Attribution called OBA2. The novelty of our approach lies in the three complementary layers: preprocessing, syntax-based attribution, and semantic-based attribution. Experiments show that our method produces results that not only are more accurate but have a meaningful connection to the authors' styles.","['Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Code (set theory)', 'Binary number', 'Attribution', 'Information retrieval', 'World Wide Web', 'Programming language', 'Natural language processing', 'Arithmetic', 'Mathematics', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Set (abstract data type)']","['Saed Alrabaee', 'Noman Saleem', 'Stere Preda', 'Lingyu Wang', 'Mourad Debbabi']",10,True,Digital Investigation,[]

Cognitive Vulnerability to Persistent Depression,1988,https://doi.org/10.1080/02699938808410927,793,"Abstract The account of cognitive vulnerability to depression offered by Beck's cognitive model is summarised. As this account currently lacks consistent empirical support, an alternative, related, account is presented. This proposes that, once a person is initially depressed, an important factor that determines whether their depression remains mild or transient, or becomes more severe and persistent, is the nature of the negative cognitive processes and constructs that become active and accessible in the depressed state. These interact with the nature of environmental difficulties, available social support, and biological factors, to determine whether a depression-maintaining cognitive-affective vicious cycle will be set up. Results from studies specifically designed to test predictions from this account have yielded positive results. Findings consistent with the hypothesis have also been obtained in other prospective studies which have shown that cognitive measures, administered in the depressed state, predict the future course of depression independently of initial levels of depression. The hypothesis is elaborated to incorporate the demonstrated relationship of elevated neuroticism to risk and persistence of depression. Recent views on the nature of sex differences in rates of depression, and on the relationship of attributional style to depression are also compatible with the hypothesis. It is concluded that the hypothesis has encouraging preliminary support. SUMMARY Two broad aspects of cognitive vulnerability to depression can be distinguished. The first is the tendency to evaluate certain types of life event in ways which will produce intense rather than mild depression. This is the aspect of vulnerability on which Beck's cognitive model appears to concentrate. There are considerable difficulties in assessing this aspect of Beck's model and it is not consistently supported by comparison of recovered depressed patients with control groups.

The first has achieved mainstream status within literary studies, while the second is little recognized. A study of the plays of Thomas Middleton compared with a large control sample shows that it is possible to achieve a good classification of his work in 2,000 word segments as against those of his contemporaries, using frequencies of very common words. Such a result can serve as the basis both for testing Middleton's hand in some disputed plays and for a description of his style. Most of «The Revenger's Tragedy», part of «The Yorkshire Tragedy», and all of «The Second Maiden's Tragedy» prove to be in a style similar to that of Middleton's uncontested plays. This style, judging by an examination of instances in context of the ten word types most strongly correlated with the Middleton-other discriminant function, is (among other things) rich in deictics and poor in conjunctions, features readily accommodated to previous descriptions including Middleton's own.

Ready to Make Nice: Parental Socialization of Young Sons' and Daughters' Prosocial Behaviors With Peers,2007,https://doi.org/10.3200/gntp.168.2.177-200,196,"In this study, the authors examined the extent to which maternal and paternal parenting styles, cognitions, and behaviors were associated with young girls' and boys' more compassionate (prototypically feminine) and more agentic (prototypically masculine) prosocial behaviors with peers. Parents of 133 preschool-aged children reported on their authoritative parenting style, attributions for children's prosocial behavior, and responses to children's prosocial behavior. Approximately 6 months later, children's more feminine and more masculine prosocial behaviors were observed during interactions with unfamiliar peers and reported on by their preschool teachers. Boys and girls did not differ in the observed and teacher-reported measures of prosocial behavior. Compared to other parents, fathers of boys were less likely to express affection or respond directly to children's prosocial behavior. Mothers' authoritative style, internal attributions for prosocial behavior, and positive responses to prosocial behavior predicted girls' displays of more feminine prosocial actions and boys' displays of more masculine prosocial actions toward peers. Relations were similar but weaker for fathers' parenting, and after accounting for mother' scores, fathers' scores accounted for unique variance in only one analysis: Teachers reported more masculine prosocial behavior in boys of fathers who discussed prosocial behavior. Overall, the results support a model of parental socialization of sex-typed prosocial behavior and indicate that mothers contribute more strongly than do fathers to both daughters' and sons' prosocial development.","['Prosocial behavior', 'Psychology', 'Socialization', 'Developmental psychology', 'Attribution', 'Helping behavior', 'Affection', 'Social psychology']","['Paul D.

An Empirical Study on Forensic Analysis of Urdu Text Using LDA-Based Authorship Attribution,2018,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2018.2885011,36,"In the recent years, text-based digital forensic has evolved into a major research domain that supports digital investigation. A piece of text can be a critical source of information that is written by somebody with respect to writing style, usage of typical vocabulary, and so on. In this paper, we present a unified approach for intelligent association analysis of text of how much a piece of text is related to a person with respect to his stylometric writing features. The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based approach emphasizes on instance-based and profile-based classification of an author's text. Here, LDA suitably handles the high dimensional and sparse data by allowing more expressive representation of text. The presented approach is an unsupervised computational methodology that can handle the heterogeneity of the dataset, diversity in writing styles of authors, and the inherent ambiguity of Urdu language text. A large corpus was collected for performance testing of the presented approach. The results of the experiments show the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art representations and other algorithms used for authorship attribution. Manifold contributions of the presented paper are use of improved sqrt-cosine similarity with LDA topics to measure similarity in vectors of text documents for the forensic analysis purpose, construction of a large data set of 6000 documents of articles, and achievement of (92% f1-measure) results on articles without using any labels for authorship attribution task.","['Computer science', 'Latent Dirichlet allocation', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Cosine similarity', 'Topic model', 'Information retrieval', 'Authorship attribution', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Rank (graph theory)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Representation (politics)', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Mathematics', 'Combinatorics', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Programming language']","['Waheed Anwar', 'Imran Sarwar Bajwa', 'M.

Effect of teaching of self-regulated learning strategies on attribution styles in students,2017,https://doi.org/10.25115/ejrep.v9i25.1470,16,"Introduction. Nowadays, self-regulated learning has become an important focus in research and a large number of studies have been undergone about self-regulation, school achievement and motivation of learning, but few researches has been done in the field of self-regulated leaning and motivational variables and attributions. This research has been undergone with the general objective of proving the effectuality of teaching of self-regulated learning strategies on attribution styles in students.Method. At this experimental study, the sample size consisted of 30 students, 15 each in experimental and control groups, and a random cluster multiple-stage sampling method was used on 2nd grade junior-high boy students of the Heptagonal-zones of the Education Office in the city of Mashhad. At first, MSLQ and attribution styles in children questionnaires were executed as a pre-test in both groups.

The Authorship of Greek Prose,1965,https://doi.org/10.2307/2344178,103,"1.1. THE study of ancient literature is limited by the uncertain authorship of the texts. External evidence of authorship is scarce and often difficult to interpret, so that stylistic evidence plays a large part in the decision about the authorship of any work. This paper extends the work of Wake (1957) on sentence-length distributions of Greek prose writers and looks at the occurrence of some common words in Greek prose, and concludes that Greek prose writers have habits which persist over long periods of time and wide ranges of subject matter. The Pauline Epistles are examined and it is shown that only four major epistles can be accepted as written by the author of Galatians. 2.1. In the study of Greek prose, the determination of authorship is a perplexing problem. When books were written and reproduced by hand, the rights of authorship were limited and what would now be considered forgery was common. The names of reputable authors were borrowed for many reasons. Soon after Isocrates died, his son complained that the booksellers were putting his father's name on any rubbish, as the name sold the book. Another common motive for substitution was prestige. Views which would receive scant attention under the name of their begetter would at least get a critical review if they bore the name of Plato or Aristotle or some leading authority in the field. Another practice, not yet extinct, was for the head of some institution, such as the medical school of Hippocrates, to have his name on all the work which emerged from the school. A last motive was the optimism of the human race, which sees the old picture in the potting shed as a Rembrandt and the old neglected letter in the church cupboard as Pauline. The result of this convention of authorship, and of these practices, is that no attribution of authorship in Greek prose can be taken at face value, it must be justified by a critical study.

Data were also collected from students and their teachers.Participating parents completed questionnaires regarding their attributions of their child's achievement and their own degree of involvement in his/her life.It was found that parents who believed that their own role was important for their child's achievement tended to be more controlling and to be keener in developing the child's interests. Also, the parental attribution of the child's achievement to the child's own effort was positively related to the child's actual achievement results. Finally, it was found that the child's actual school achievement was directly related to the parental interest-developing behaviour, but it was not significantly related to the parental controlling behaviour.Through a structural equation model and a path analysis procedure, it was shown that a line of influence exists between parental attribution style, the type and degree of parental involvement and the child's actual academic achievement.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Academic achievement', 'Path analysis (statistics)', 'Parenting styles', 'Social psychology', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']",['Στέλιος Ν.

Compared to desisting ex-offenders, active offenders tend to interpret negative events in their lives as being the product of internal, stable, and global forces. On the other hand, active offenders were more likely to believe that the good events in their lives were the product of external, unstable and specific causes.

Text Classification for Authorship Attribution Using Naive Bayes Classifier with Limited Training Data,2014,,38,"Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying authors of disputed or anonymous texts. It can be seen as a single, multi-class text classification task. It is concerned with writing style rather than topic matter. The scalability issue in traditional AA studies concerns the effect of data size, the amount of data per candidate author. This has not been probed in much depth yet, since most stylometry researches tend to focus on long texts per author or multiple short texts, because stylistic choices frequently occur less in such short texts. This paper investigates the task of authorship attribution on short historical Arabic texts written by10 different authors. Several experiments are conducted on these texts by extracting various lexical and character features of the writing style of each author, using N-grams word level (1,2,3, and 4) and character level (1,2,3, and 4) grams as a text representation. Then Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is employed in order to classify the texts to their authors. This is to show robustness of NB classifier in doing AA on very short-sized texts when compared to Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using dataset (called AAAT) which consists of 3 short texts per author’s book, it is shown our method is at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) for the selection of the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the significance of punctuation marks is explored in order to distinguish between authors, showing that an increase in the performance can be achieved. As well, the NB classifier achieved high accuracy results. Since the experiments of AA task that are done on AAAT dataset show interesting results with a classification accuracy of the best score obtained up to 96% using N-gram word level 1gram.

The Influence of Attributional Style on Substance Use and Risky Sexual Behavior among College Students.,2013,,23,"HIV, AIDS, STIs, and unwanted pregnancy continue to impact young adults in the U.S. at a disproportionate rate, particularly during the college years. Attributional style (i.e., locus of control) influences one's HIV risk. Internal locus of control indicates a lower risk of HIV infection, whereas an external locus of control signals an increased risk of HIV. A sample of 1,874 university students aged 16-54 years were surveyed to determine if sexually active males versus females with external, unstable, and specific causal attribution (i.e., external locus of control) engaged in safer sexual practices (e.g., condom use) and lesser alcohol and legal/illicit drug use. Results indicated that male students with an external attributional style engaged in a greater number of unsafe sexual behaviors (e.g., multiple partners) and higher amounts of alcohol and drug use than female students. Additionally, for both males and females, an internal attributional style was associated with greater drug use and a greater likelihood to engage in HIV-related risk behavior. Comprehensive sexual health and substance use education targeting college students should consider attributional style in relation to health promoting and protective behaviors.

Married spouses completed measures of anxious and avoidant attachment, negative attributions, and perceived marital support and conflict. Attachment style was related to marital adjustment and to attribution style, with anxious attachment being a stronger predictor than avoidant attachment. The interaction of husbands' and wives' attachment styles also predicted marital functioning. In some cases, the tendency to make negative attributions for spouse behavior mediated the effects of attachment style on marital adjustment. Couples also participated in a marital interaction task involving two social situation manipulations - an agency threat (i.e., evaluation) and a communion threat (i.e., disagreement with one's spouse). Following the task, participants completed a measure assessing their appraisals of their spouses' behavior. Attachment style interacted with the social situation manipulations to affect spouse appraisals. The results support the general hypothesis that adult attachment style predicts functioning in intimate relationships, and suggest that cognitive processes may form part of the path explaining this association.","['Psychology', 'Spouse', 'Attachment theory', 'Attribution', 'Association (psychology)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Social psychology', 'Social relation', 'Partner effects', 'Archaeology', 'Communication', 'Sociology', 'Anthropology', 'Psychotherapist', 'History']","['Linda C.

Adolescent predictor variables included demographic characteristics, psychosocial variables, characteristics of adolescent major depressive disorder, comorbidity, family history of major depressive disorder and nonmood disorder, and antisocial and borderline personality disorder symptoms.Low levels of excessive emotional reliance, a single episode of major depressive disorder in adolescence, low proportion of family members with recurrent major depressive disorder, low levels of antisocial and borderline personality disorder symptoms, and a positive attributional style (males only) independently predicted which formerly depressed adolescents would remain free of future psychopathology. Female gender, multiple major depressive disorder episodes in adolescence, higher proportion of family members with recurrent major depressive disorder, elevated borderline personality disorder symptoms, and conflict with parents (females only) independently predicted recurrent major depressive disorder. Comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders in adolescence and elevated antisocial personality disorder symptoms independently distinguished adolescents who developed recurrent major depressive disorder comorbid with nonmood disorder from those who developed pure major depressive disorder.Formerly depressed adolescents with the risk factors identified in this study are at elevated risk for recurrence of major depressive disorder during young adulthood and therefore warrant continued monitoring and preventive or prophylactic treatment.","['Psychology', 'Sample (material)', 'Young adult', 'Major depressive disorder', 'Course (navigation)', 'Natural (archaeology)', 'Life course approach', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Medicine', 'Developmental psychology', 'History', 'Chemistry', 'Physics', 'Cognition', 'Archaeology', 'Chromatography', 'Astronomy']","['Peter M.

The model included twelve possible predictive factors including math background, attribution for success/failure (luck, effort, difficulty of task, and ability), domain specific self-efficacy, encouragement, comfort level in the course, work style preference, previous programming experience, previous non-programming computer experience, and gender. Subjects included 105 students enrolled in a CS1 introductory computer science course at a midwestern university. The study revealed three predictive factors in the following order of importance: comfort level, math, and attribution to luck for success/failure. Comfort level and math background were found to have a positive influence on success, whereas attribution to luck had a negative influence. The study also revealed by considering the different types of previous computer experiences (including formal programming class, self-initiated programming, internet use, game playing, and productivity software use) that both a formal class in programming and game playing were predictive of success.

Backchannels across cultures: A study of Americans and Japanese,1989,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047404500013270,199,"ABSTRACT The frequency of listener responses, called backchannels , was studied in English conversations within and across two cultural groups: Americans from the midwestern United States and Japanese who were born and raised in Japan. The findings reveal that backchannels of several types are displayed far more frequently by Japanese listeners. This appears to be related to the greater use by Japanese of certain discourse constructions that favor backchannels, and to the Japanese culture. The Japanese listening style remains unchanged in cross-cultural conversations, but Americans alter listening style in the direction of their non-native interlocutors. The study found no evidence for the hypothesis that backchanneling conventions that are not shared contribute to negative personality attributions or stereotyping.

Enhancing attributional style as a resiliency factor in depressogenic stress generation,2012,https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2012.684381,15,"Abstract There is a growing body of evidence that suggests depression and cognitive vulnerabilities to depression may lead individuals to generate stressful events. However, there has been no study to date that has directly examined factors that may lead individuals to be less likely to generate stressful events. The present study examines whether an enhancing attributional style, the tendency to make global and stable inferences following occurrence of a positive event, functions as a resiliency factor in stress generation. One hundred and sixty-seven female students completed measures of depression symptoms and attributional style at baseline and occurrence of life events since baseline at a four-week follow-up. Results indicated that an enhancing attributional style predicted decreased levels of stressful events over the following four weeks, even when controlling for depression symptoms. The findings of this study suggest that there may be resiliency factors that can help protect individuals from the generation of stressful events.","['Psychology', 'Depression (economics)', 'Attribution', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Cognitive style', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Evan M.

The present study examined the relations among shyness, attributional styles and self‐esteem. It was hypothesized that self‐esteem mediated the effects of attributional styles on shyness. Methods Self‐reported data on degree of shyness, attributional styles and self‐esteem were obtained from 326 Chinese children with mean age of 10.85 years. Results It was found that positive attributional styles predicted shyness in the negative direction and the effects were fully mediated by self‐esteem, and negative attributional styles predicted shyness in the positive direction both directly and through self‐esteem. Conclusion The results imply that how children attribute positive and negative outcomes affect both self‐esteem and shyness. It is suggested that practitioners should conduct attribution‐retraining workshops for shy children and help teachers and parents learn how to mitigate negative attributional style and foster positive attributional styles in children.","['Shyness', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Self-esteem', 'Developmental psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Social psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Archaeology', 'Communication', 'Psychiatry', 'History']","['Siu Mui Chan', 'Kit Yi Angel Wong']",46,False,Child Care Health and Development,[]

The basic design was: power of style (high-low) X reciprocity of style (similar-dissimilar styles) X role (counsellor-client). Data were subjected to factor analyses and multivariate analyses of variance. Among others, results indicated that the high-power style produced higher ratings of Socio-Intellectual Status and Attractiveness, especially when this style was non-reciprocal.

E-mail authorship attribution using customized associative classification,2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2015.05.012,36,"E-mail communication is often abused for conducting social engineering attacks including spamming, phishing, identity theft and for distributing malware. This is largely attributed to the problem of anonymity inherent in the standard electronic mail protocol. In the literature, authorship attribution is studied as a text categorization problem where the writing styles of individuals are modeled based on their previously written sample documents. The developed model is employed to identify the most plausible writer of the text. Unfortunately, most existing studies focus solely on improving predictive accuracy and not on the inherent value of the evidence collected. In this study, we propose a customized associative classification technique, a popular data mining method, to address the authorship attribution problem. Our approach models the unique writing style features of a person, measures the associativity of these features and produces an intuitive classifier.

"She Dresses to Attract, He Perceives Seduction: A Gender Gap in Attribution of Intent to Women’s Revealing Style of Dress and its Relation to Blaming the Victims of Sexual Violence",2010,,48,"Abstract Victims of sexual violence are often blamed for precipitating their own assault with their so-called provocative body-revealing style of dress, which is viewed as conveying consent for sexual advances. To explore some of the grounds for this allegation as well as its accurateness, the present study examines the attributions made by both sexes regarding the motivation for women's sexualized appearance. The factual connection between revealing clothing and actual occurrences of sexual invasions is examined as well. The results demonstrate a gender-based attribution gap wherein men report perceiving the sexualized look as indicating an interest in sex and intent to seduce, whereas women cite their wish to feel and look attractive as its primary cause, while entirely rejecting the seduction claim. This gap is examined in the context of the current widespread sexual objectification of women and the social construction of female beauty in sexual terms, as well as the finding that in reality there is no connection between style of dress and sexual victimization of any sort. Keywords: Misperception of sexual intent, Rape myths, Body-revealing appearance ********** Blaming the victim of sexual violence for precipitating her own victimization is a rather common practice in present society (Ardovini-Brooker & Caringella-MacDonald, 2002; Burt, 1980; Cowan, 2000; De Judicibus & McCabe, 2001; Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994; Kopper, 1996; Koss & Harvey, 1991). These stereotyped attitudes, generally subsumed in the term myths (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994), typically revolve around the notion that victims somehow contributed to their own victimization and are therefore responsible for its occurrence (Koss & Harvey, 1991). Perpetrators frequently use these claims in their defense, and society is all too willing, even eager, to cooperate with this line of argumentation and lay the bulk of the blame on those who were attacked.

Masking topic‐related information to enhance authorship attribution,2017,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23968,40,"Authorship attribution attempts to reveal the authors of documents. In recent years, research in this field has grown rapidly. However, the performance of state‐of‐the‐art methods is heavily affected when text of known authorship and texts under investigation differ in topic and/or genre. So far, it is not clear how to quantify the personal style of authors in a way that is not affected by topic shifts or genre variations. In this paper, a set of text distortion methods are used attempting to mask topic‐related information. These methods transform the input texts into a more topic‐neutral form while maintaining the structure of documents associated with the personal style of the author. Using a controlled corpus that includes a fine‐grained range of topics and genres it is demonstrated how the proposed approach can be combined with existing authorship attribution methods to enhance their performance in very challenging tasks, especially in cross‐topic attribution. We also examine cross‐genre attribution and the most challenging, yet realistic, cross‐topic‐and‐genre attribution scenarios and show how the proposed techniques should be tuned to enhance performance in these tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that there are important differences in attribution effectiveness when either conversational genres, nonconversational genres, or a mix of them are considered.","['Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Authorship attribution', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Masking (illustration)', 'Information retrieval', 'Natural language processing', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'History', 'Art', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology', 'Pure mathematics', 'Visual arts', 'Programming language']",['Efstathios Stamatatos'],50,False,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,[]

Using voxel-based morphometry to investigate neuroanatomical regions putatively supporting social cognition, risk carriers had relatively increased grey matter volume in the right temporal pole and right anterior cingulate cortex (Pcorrected<0.05) in the Irish healthy controls sample; neuroanatomical associations between CNNM2 and grey matter volume in anterior cingulate cortex were also observed in the Italian schizophrenia and healthy controls samples.Although the biological role of CNNM2 in schizophrenia remains unknown, these data suggest that this CNNM2 risk variant rs7914558 may have an impact on neural systems relevant to social cognition.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - personality and attributional style of patients in comparison to healthy controls and depressed individuals,1999,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638239917274,16,"Aspects of personality or attributional style may account for the previously reported (Farmer et al., 1996) discrepancy between self-reported and objectively rated psychiatric morbidity in subjects with operationally defined Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) and the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) (Peterson et al., 1982) have been administered to CFS patients, depressed subjects and two healthy control groups for comparison. Sixty-two CFS subjects and 48 psychologically healthy controls completed the EPQ. Fifty CFS subjects, 100 healthy controls and 37 depressed individuals completed the ASQ. CFS subjects with concurrent depression scored significantly higher than CFS subjects without depression or healthy controls on the neuroticism subscale of the EPQ. For the social desirability subscale, CFS patients scored no different from the controls. The attributional style of CFS patients for good events resembled the healthy group. However, CFS patients tend to view bad events as due to external factors beyond personal control yet which are immutable (stable) and which affect all aspects of life (global). Composite ASQ scores for bad events for CFS patients with concurrent depression resembled the depressed group while the non-depressed CFS patient's responses resembled healthy subjects. Scores on the EPQ and ASQ in CFS subjects are no different from healthy controls except for those CFS subjects who are also concurrently depressed where the scores resemble patients with depression. Thus these measures have not explained the discrepant self-report and clinical interview rating of psychiatric morbidity in CFS patients. However, the external, global and stable attributions for bad events may explain the immutable views some CFS patients have regarding the physical nature of their illness.","['Neuroticism', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Eysenck Personality Questionnaire', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychology', 'Personality', 'Psychiatry', 'Attribution', 'Clinical psychology', 'Extraversion and introversion', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Social psychology', 'Macroeconomics', 'Economics']",['Irene Jones Helen.

"Relationship between attributional style, perceived control, self‐esteem, and depressive mood in a nonclinical sample: A structural equation‐modelling approach",2012,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8341.2012.02067.x,20,"The aim of this study was to examine the intricate relationship between some personality traits (i.e., attributional style, perceived control over consequences, self-esteem), and depressive mood in a nonclinical sample (N= 334). Method. Structural equation modelling was used to estimate five competing models: two vulnerability models describing the effects of personality traits on depressive mood, one scar model describing the effects of depression on personality traits, a mixed model describing the effects of attributional style and perceived control over consequences on depressive mood, which in turn affects self-esteem, and a reciprocal model which is a non-recursive version of the mixed model that specifies bidirectional effects between depressive mood and self-esteem.The best-fitting model was the mixed model. Moreover, we observed a significant negative effect of depression on self-esteem, but no effect in the opposite direction.These findings provide supporting arguments against the continuum model of the relationship between self-esteem and depression, and lend substantial support to the scar model, which claims that depressive mood damages and erodes self-esteem. In addition, the 'depressogenic' nature of the pessimistic attributional style, and the 'antidepressant' nature of perceived control over consequences plead in favour of the vulnerability model.","['Psychology', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Self-esteem', 'Personality', 'Mood', 'Clinical psychology', 'Attribution', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']","['Julie Ledrich', 'Kamel Gana']",96,False,Psychology and Psychotherapy Theory Research and Practice,[]
The Pragmatic American: Attributions of Crime and the Hydraulic Relation Hypothesis,2009,https://doi.org/10.1080/07418820902855362,84,"Abstract Attribution theory argues that a ""hydraulic relation"" exists between dispositional and situational attribution styles, causing people to endorse one style at the expense of the other. That is, attribution theorists predict that there should be a strong negative relationship between attribution styles. We test this prediction using data collected in Hillsborough County (Tampa), Florida, and two national polls. Our investigation shows that, rather than a bifurcated view of crime causation, Americans manifest a complex attributional style that views crime emerging from multiple sources. We discuss how these findings reveal that the American public tends to be not ideological but pragmatic in its view of crime causation and, ultimately, in the crime control policies it is willing to endorse. Keywords: public opinionattribution theorypunitiveness Notes 1. Our focus here is in exploring the alleged sharp distinctions that have been portrayed by those who endorse a dispositional attribution style—a punitive approach to crime—versus those who embrace a situational attribution style. We are not dismissing the fact that there are other pointed cleavages in public opinion when citizens are queried about crime. For example, Unnever, Cullen, and Jonson (Citation2008) show that there are sharp racial divisions in support for the death penalty; the majority of African Americans oppose whereas the majority of whites support capital punishment. 2. Choi et al. (Citation1999) highlight numerous reasons why Westerners such as those in the USA tend to gravitate toward a dispositional attribution style when compared to their Eastern counterparts. For example, they argue that Easterners are more sensitive to situational influences on behavior and view the group as the natural unit of agency whereas Westerners tend to view the individual as the unit of agency and tend to discount situational influences on behavior.

The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the relationship between attri butional style and self-esteem and attributional style and academic performance in Black high school and college students. The results indicated that an internal attributional style for negative events was negatively associated with self-esteem. A stable attributional style for negative events was negatively associated with academic performance.

Attributional Style and School Truancy,2001,https://doi.org/10.1080/0300443011690102,8,"Abstract Relatively little research has been directed toward exploring cognitive variables that may characterize students with poor school attendance. A handful of studies has examined school attendance in relation to locus of control, but none has explored its relationship to “attributional style”. This article presents the findings of a pilot study which compared a small sample of truants and non‐truants on locus of control and attributional style. The findings suggest that attributional style is a significant cognitive factor in explaining why some students play truant from school but others do not, even though they are under the influence of similar school conditions. Specifically, truants tended to explain failures as due to internal, stable and global factors, whereas non‐truants tended to explain failures as due to external, unstable and specific factors. On the other hand, truants tended to explain success as due to external, unstable and specific factors; whereas non‐truants tended to explain success as due to internal, stable and global factors.

This overview is an attempt to explore the ""optimism"" concept and its relations with mental health, physical health, coping, quality of life and adaptation of purpose, health lifestyle and risk perception. Positive and negative expectations regarding the future are important for understanding the vulnerability to mental disorders, in particular mood and anxiety disorders, as well as to physical illness. A significant positive relation emerges between optimism and coping strategies focused on social support and emphasis on positive aspects of stressful situations. Through employment of specific coping strategies, optimism exerts an indirect influence also on the quality of life. There is evidence that optimistic people present a higher quality of life compared to those with low levels of optimism or even pessimists. Optimism may significantly influence mental and physical well-being by the promotion of a healthy lifestyle as well as by adaptive behaviours and cognitive responses, associated with greater flexibility, problem-solving capacity and a more efficient elaboration of negative information.","['Optimism', 'Psychology', 'Mental health', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Perception', 'Illusion', 'Cognition', 'Disposition', 'Optimism bias', 'Physical health', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Psychiatry', 'Neuroscience']","['Ciro Conversano', 'Alessandro Rotondo', 'E.

The central goal of this study was to explore how childrearing contexts might moderate relations between parenting styles and mothers' parental beliefs and emotional responses. Design. Participants were 76 mothers of children (41 boys, 35 girls) ranging in age from 30 to 70 months. Mothers completed a global measure of parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative). Self-reports of parental beliefs (parental goals, attributions) and emotional responses (angry, embarrassed, happy) were assessed in response to hypothetical vignettes depicting a variety of children's behaviors (aggression, misbehavior, shyness, prosocial behavior). Results. In situations depicting children's negative behaviors, authoritarian mothers were less focused on empathic goals and attributed child aggression and misbehaviors to less external sources than their more authoritative counterparts. Authoritarian mothers were also more likely to respond with greater anger and embarrassment across all childrearing scenarios. Conclusions. Results suggest that authoritarian and authoritative mothers differ in their affective response patterns consistently across childrearing contexts, but that more challenging childrearing situations accentuate differences in the cognitive reactions of authoritative versus authoritarian mothers. Implications for understanding how general parenting styles may be translated into specific parental responses are considered.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Authoritarianism', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Parenting styles', 'Political science', 'Politics', 'Law', 'Democracy']","['Robert J.

The first was a quantitative experiment involving crowd-sourcing, while the second was a qualitative one executed by the authors of this paper. Both studies confirmed that this task is quite challenging. To gain a better understanding of how humans tackle such a problem, we conducted an exploratory data analysis on the results of the studies.

We used a modification of the cue-use paradigm developed by Ajzen (1977, Experiment 1) and examined depressed and nondepressed people's predictions of the likelihood of future positive and negative outcomes for themselves and for others. The results provided strong support for pessimism on the part of depressed individuals relative to nondepressed individuals in forecasts for both self and others.

A ruminative response style to depression is associated with faulty attribution and higher dysfunctional beliefs, which in turn is associated with a higher level of depression and hopelessness. Distraction is associated with less severe depression. Evidence supporting these hypotheses mainly comes from a non-clinical population. Hence it is not clear if these theories apply to clinical depression.One hundred and nine out-patients suffering from unipolar major depressive disorder were recruited to test these theories, using model-fitting analysis technique.Certain rumination responses to depression were associated with higher levels of depression and hopelessness, faulty attribution and dysfunctional attitudes when gender and the level of depression were controlled. Principal component analysis of the Rumination Scale yielded four factors: 'symptom-based rumination', 'isolation/introspection', 'self-blame' and 'analyse to understand'. Unlike the other factors, 'analyse to understand' did not correlate with the level of depression. Model fitting analysis, though not reflecting entirely the true model, captures most of the hypothesized relationships between important variables. Neuroticism was associated with stress. Rumination was associated with an increased level of dysfunctional beliefs and faulty attribution, which in turn was associated with increased severity of depression.

Moreover, it was hypothesized that high scores on Zuckerman's disinhibition subscale and low self‐esteem were related to larger food intake. Main findings were that a manipulated weight increase indeed lowered the mood of restrained eaters, whereas it had no effect on the mood of unrestrained eaters. However, the weight increase and the mood decrease of restrained subjects in the high‐weight condition were not reflected in a more depressive attributional style and increased food intake. Level of self‐esteem appeared to be the best and only predictor of restrained eaters' food intake with lower‐self‐esteem subjects eating less during the taste test.

Pupils’ causal attributions for difficult classroom behaviour,2000,https://doi.org/10.1348/000709900157985,93,"Studies of causal attributions within educational contexts have tended to concentrate on academic performance. There have been a smaller number of investigations of teachers' attributions for pupils' behaviour in school.The present study examines the causal attribution made by pupils for difficult behaviour in classrooms. It reveals the structure of these attributions and serves as a comparison with the teacher studies.The participants were 105 pupils (52 males and 53 females) in the first year of secondary schooling, all drawn from the same inner city school.Four initial small group interviews were used to identify a wide range of factors that pupils viewed as being causes of difficult classroom behaviour in the 18 primary schools they had previously attended. A questionnaire was then constructed incorporating items from these discussions and administered to the whole of the year group of pupils, but omitting the participants in the initial group discussions.The results of a factor analysis indicated that pupils' attributions for misbehaviour at school were best represented by four factors: (1) 'fairness of teacher's actions', (2) 'pupil vulnerability', (3) 'adverse family circumstances' and (4) 'strictness of classroom regime'. While there were no gender differences, pupils saw the 'fairness of teacher's actions' and 'pupil vulnerability' as more significant contributors to pupil misbehaviour than either 'adverse family circumstances' or 'strictness of classroom regime'.The attributions by pupils for difficult classroom behaviour differ markedly from those obtained in studies of teachers. Policy and practice initiatives which do not attend to conflicting attributional styles are unlikely to succeed in improving levels of pupil behaviour in schools.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Pupil', 'Vulnerability (computing)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Computer security', 'Neuroscience', 'Computer science']","['Andy Miller', 'Eamonn Ferguson', 'Irene Byrne']",0,True,British Journal of Educational Psychology,[]

Participants ( n = 352) who were currently involved in a romantic relationship completed multiple measures of attachment, attributions, and relationship quality. Results revealed that secure people reported less maladaptive attributions than insecure people. In addition, structural model analyses indicated that attachment model of the self (but not the model of others) had both a direct and an indirect effect, mediated by attributions made for negative partner behavior, on relationship satisfaction. Attributions made for self‐ and partner behaviors overlapped to a great extent, implying an attributional style underlying this unique response pattern. These findings suggest that a positive model of self is a valuable personal resource that enhances adaptive attributions, and hence, leads to high levels of relationship quality.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Attachment theory', 'Social psychology', 'Romance', 'Developmental psychology', 'Quality (philosophy)', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Psychoanalysis']","['Nebi Sümer', 'Catherine Cozzarelli']",58,False,Personal Relationships,[]
High implicit self‐esteem is not necessarily advantageous: discrepancies between explicit and implicit self‐esteem and their relationship with anger expression and psychological health,2007,https://doi.org/10.1002/per.626,229,"Two studies investigated how discrepancies between implicit and explicit self‐esteem are related to mental and physical health. We found that, compared to congruent self‐esteem, discrepant self‐esteem was related to more anger suppression, a more depressive attributional style, more nervousness, and more days of impaired health. The result applies not only to fragile (high explicit, low implicit) self‐esteem, but also to damaged (low explicit, high implicit) self‐esteem. These findings show that high implicit self‐esteem is not necessarily advantageous. In individuals with low explicit self‐esteem having high implicit self‐esteem was related to more health problems than having low implicit self‐esteem.

Relationships among attributions and clusters of PTSD symptoms represented by the 4-factor dysphoria model were also examined. Trauma-specific attributions were most predictive of PTSD symptoms, with higher associations for avoidance and numbing symptoms compared to arousal symptoms in the three-factor model and higher associations for dysphoria symptoms compared to arousal and avoidance symptoms in the four-factor dysphoria model.

"Attributions of personality based on physical appearance, speech, and handwriting.",1986,https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.50.4.792,86,"The effect of facial appearance, speech style, and handwriting on personality attributions was examined. The source consistency hypothesis predicted that an actor will receive consistent attributions across all three types of information. The differential information hypothesis predicted that different personality dimensions are used to differentiate the actors within each type of information. In a 3 X 6 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) design, each judge rated a single actor/information combination on scales of social evaluation, intellectual evaluation, activity, potency, emotionality, and sociability. Photographs of actors were differentiated primarily in terms of positive social and intellectual evaluation; the speech of actors was differentiated primarily along an activity dimension; and the writing of the actors was differentiated primarily along a potency dimension. This study supported the differential information hypothesis and suggested that these three types of information about an actor may lead judges to use different personality dimensions. Person perception studies have shown that observers readily make attributions about the personality traits, abilities, and emotions of other persons based on limited information. Three types of information have been extensively studied: facial appearance, expressive noncontent characteristics of speech (such as pitch, tone, and tempo), and handwriting. Numerous studies have reported that facial features and expression influence attributions about the attractiveness, pleasantness, intellectual and social skills, and mental health of the target person (Adams, 1977; Berscheid & Walster, 1974; Bull & Stevens, 1979; Dion, Ber","['Psychology', 'Handwriting', 'Attribution', 'Personality', 'Social psychology', 'Social perception', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Perception', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience']","['Rebecca M.

Identifying Authorship by Byte-Level N-Grams: The Source Code Author Profile (SCAP) Method.,2007,,119,"Source code author identification deals with identifying the most likely author of a computer program, given a set of predefined author candidates. There are several scenarios where digital evidence of this kind plays a role in investigation and adjudication, such as code authorship disputes, intellectual property infringement, tracing the source of code left in the system after a cyber attack, and so forth. As in any identification task, the disputed program is compared to undisputed, known programming samples by the predefined author candidates. We present a new approach, called the SCAP (Source Code Author Profiles) approach, based on byte-level n-gram profiles representing the source code author’s style. The SCAP method extends a method originally applied to natural language text authorship attribution; we show that an n-gram approach also suits the characteristics of source code analysis. The methodological extension includes a simplified profile and a less complicated, but more effective, similarity measure. Experiments on data sets of different programming-language (Java or C++) and commented/commentless code demonstrate the effectiveness of these extensions. The SCAP approach is programming-language independent. Moreover, the SCAP approach deals surprisingly well with cases where only a limited amount of very short programs per programmer is available for training. Finally, it is also demonstrated that SCAP effectiveness persists even in the absence of comments in the source code, a condition usually met in cyber-crime cases. 1. The Forensic Significance of Source Code Nowadays, in a wide variety of legal cases it is important to identify the author of a usually limited piece of programming code.

THE PRAGMATIC AMERICAN: EMPIRICAL REALITY OR METHODOLOGICAL ARTIFACT?,2014,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12035,104,"Scholars widely agree that the public is pragmatic about criminal justice. The empirical basis for this conclusion is the failure in several previous studies to find a sizable negative relationship between dispositional and situational crime attributions, or between support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies. We suggest, however, that public pragmatism may be an artifact of the use of unidirectional question batteries in prior research to measure attribution styles and policy support. When such questions are used, acquiescent responding can introduce systematic error that is positively correlated across items and scales. Drawing on data from an experiment with a national sample (N = 826) of Internet panelists, we examine how this methodological approach impacts the bivariate correlations and multivariate relationships between attribution styles and between support for punitive and rehabilitative crime policies. The findings reveal that using unidirectional sets of questions to measure these concepts likely results in 1) inflated alpha reliability coefficients, 2) an underestimation of the magnitude of the negative relationships between attribution styles and between punitiveness and support for rehabilitation, and 3) an underestimation of the extent to which punitiveness and support for rehabilitation are driven by the same factors, working in opposite directions.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Punitive damages', 'Social psychology', 'Artifact (error)', 'Bivariate analysis', 'Judgement', 'Empirical research', 'Political science', 'Computer science', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience', 'Machine learning', 'Law']","['Justin T.

The present study sought to investigate the nature of the relationship between attributional style and depression in a male prison sample.

Severity of self-reported depressive symptoms in the present sample was comparable to other prison and clinical samples, but higher than community samples. Participants were more severely affected by depressive symptoms than anxiety. The original attributional dimensions (i.e. internal, stable, and global) predicted a significant amount of variance in depression, but the model was not significant after controlling for anxiety. A subsequent regression model, comprising attributional dimensions for both negative events and positive events including a measure of 'uncontrollability', accounted for 35% of the variance in depression and the model retained significance while controlling for anxiety. An attributional model of depression may be relevant to the prison population and could provide a valid insight into the development and treatment of depressive symptoms in prisoners.

Fragile Self and Malevolent Others: Biased Attribution Styles in Individuals at Ultra-High Risk for Psychosis,2018,https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2018.05.08,12,"Biased attribution styles of assigning hostile intention to innocent others and placing the blame were found in schizophrenia. Attribution styles in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, however, have been less studied especially for its association with various psychological factors. We investigated whether UHR individuals show increased hostility perception and blaming bias and explored the associations of these biased styles of attribution with the factor structure of multifaceted self-related psychological variables and neurocognitive performances.Fifty-four UHR individuals and 80 healthy controls were assessed by evaluating resilience, self-perception, self-esteem, and aberrant subjective experiences of schizotypy (physical anhedonia, social anhedonia, magical ideation, and perceptual aberration), basic symptoms, and carrying out a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery. Attribution styles were assessed using the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire.UHR individuals, compared with normal controls, showed increased hostility perception and blaming bias. Factor analysis of self-related psychological variables and neurocognitive performances in the entire subject population showed a three-factor solution, which was designated as reflective self, pre-reflective self, and neurocognition. Multiple regression analysis in UHR individuals revealed that hostility perception bias was associated with reflective self and composite blame bias was associated with reflective and pre-reflective self.This study supports the emergence of attribution biases in the putative 'prodromal' phase of schizophrenia.

Attributing Authorship in the Noisy Digitized Correspondence of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,2018,https://doi.org/10.3389/fdigh.2018.00004,22,"This article presents the results of a multidisciplinary project aimed at better understanding the impact of different digitization strategies in computational text analysis. More specifically, it describes an effort to automatically discern the authorship of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in a body of uncorrected correspondence processed by HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) and OCR (Optical Character Recognition), reporting on the effect this noise has on the analyses necessary to computationally identify the different writing style of the two brothers. In summary, our findings show that OCR digitization serves as a reliable proxy for the more painstaking process of manual digitization, at least when it comes to authorship attribution. Our results suggest that attribution is viable even when using training and test sets from different digitization pipelines. With regard to HTR, this research demonstrates that even though automated transcription significantly increases risk of text misclassification when compared to OCR, a cleanliness above ≈ 20% is already sufficient to achieve a higher-than-chance probability of correct binary attribution.","['Digitization', 'Computer science', 'Attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Authorship attribution', 'Optical character recognition', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Speech recognition', 'Information retrieval', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Computer vision', 'Social psychology']","['Greta Franzini', 'Mike Kestemont', 'Gabriela Rotari', 'Melina Jander', 'Jeremi K.

Stakeholders also completed a survey assessing their attribution styles. Results indicated that perceptions of blame were affected by the interaction of stakeholder role (i.e., active vs. passive) with attribution style (i.e., optimistic vs. pessimistic).

Few studies have empirically examined its underlying factor structure.Aims: This study (1) examines the factor structure of social cognition in both a sample of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and non-clinical controls and (2) explores relationships of factors to neurocognition, symptoms and functioning.Method: A factor analysis was conducted on social cognition measures in a sample of 65 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 50 control participants. The resulting factors were examined for their relationships to symptoms and functioning.Results: Results suggested a two-factor structure in the schizophrenia sample (social cognition skill and hostile attributional style) and a three-factor structure in the non-clinical sample (hostile attributional style, higher-level inferential processing and lower-level cue detection). In the schizophrenia sample, the social cognition skill factor was significantly related to negative symptoms and social functioning, whereas hostile attributional style predicted positive and general psychopathology symptoms.Conclusions: The factor structure of social cognition in schizophrenia separates hostile attributional style and social cognition skill, and each show differential relationships to relevant clinical variables in schizophrenia.Keywords: Cognitive impairmentschizophreniasocial cognitiontheory of mind Declaration of interestThe authors report no conflicts of interest.

Social cognition and subclinical paranoid ideation,2001,https://doi.org/10.1348/014466501163670,157,"A number of cognitive biases have been identified relevant to persecutory thought (e.g. exaggerated self-serving bias). Moreover, findings of increased depressed mood in conjunction with high levels of self-esteem have contributed to theories of persecutory ideation (e.g. Bentall, Kinderman, Kaney, 1994). Using a nonclinical sample, the present study sought to expand upon previous research by examining the linear relationship between persecutory ideation and multiple clinical and social cognitive variables.A cross-sectional design was used. Correlational and multiple regression analyses were conducted.One hundred and ninety-three undergraduate students were administered a battery of questionnaires which assessed the following domains: Paranoid ideation, depression, social anxiety, self-monitoring, attributional style and self-esteem.Higher levels of paranoid ideation were significantly associated with greater depressed mood, social anxiety and avoidance, evaluation apprehension, self-monitoring and lower self-esteem. There were no significant associations between paranoid ideation and attributional biases.These findings suggest that mood, anxiety and perceptions of the self are related to paranoid ideation in a nonclinical sample. These findings are tempered, however, by studying a nonclinical sample and the self-report measures of paranoid ideation that might be assessing multiple aspects of paranoid thought (e.g. ideas of reference).","['Psychology', 'Paranoia', 'Anxiety', 'Social anxiety', 'Ideation', 'Mood', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Cognitive science']","['James A.

Patients' implicit self-decreasing AS was associated with low implicit self-esteem. In addition, compared to remitted patients and controls, deluded patients presented low explicit and normal implicit self-esteem.The results shed light on the inconsistent findings in previous studies and indicate that persecutory delusions might be fed by implicit self-decreasing AS and an unstable self-esteem.","['Psychology', 'Situational ethics', 'Implicit attitude', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Implicit-association test', 'Implicit personality theory', 'Implicit memory', 'Psychosis', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Personality', 'Archaeology', 'History']","['Stephanie Mehl', 'Winfried Rief', 'Eva Lüllmann', 'Michael Ziegler', 'Matthias J.

The three factors are attribution style, level of identification with a celebrity endorser, and level of brand commitment. Conducted through the Internet, the experiment recruited a total of 229 students from a southwestern university in the USA. The study found that people making dispositional attributions judged the endorsed brand more negatively than those making situational attributions. Confronted with negative celebrity information, consumers who identified highly with the celebrity were likely to maintain a positive attitude toward a brand and continue purchasing it. In the same conditions, people with high brand commitment showed more positive brand evaluation as well as higher purchase intention than people with low brand commitment.

Consistent with the proposed model, the globality dimension did not contribute uniquely. As expected, the controllability dimension was a particularly strong predictor of problems in living. Most important was the finding of several strong dimensional interactions, in which the effect of controllability attributional style on problems in living depended upon stability and locus attributional style. Additional analyses revealed that success and failure attributional style contribute interactively to the prediction of problems in living, and that loneliness is more uniquely associated with attributional style for interpersonal situations.

A total of 78 boys age 15 and 16 years were allocated to either undertake MoodGYM or to standard personal development activities. Outcomes were measured before commencement, post-program and 16 weeks post-program. There were no significant between-group differences in change scores pre- to post- or pre- to follow-up using the intention to treat sample or for participants with post- and/or follow-up data.

Both groups showed improvement in their beliefs about depression at follow-up, with the control group showing a moderate relative benefit (ES = 0.40). While the numbers are small, there was a reduction in the risk of being depressed in the MoodGYM group of 9% at post-treatment compared with a slightly increased risk for the control group. The risk of being classified as vulnerable to depression reduced by 17% in the MoodGYM group at post-treatment compared with no change in risk for the control group.

Attributional Style and Depression in Multiple Sclerosis,2013,https://doi.org/10.7224/1537-2073.2012-021,7,"Several etiologic theories have been proposed to explain depression in the general population. Studying these models and modifying them for use in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population may allow us to better understand depression in MS. According to the reformulated learned helplessness (LH) theory, individuals who attribute negative events to internal, stable, and global causes are more vulnerable to depression. This study differentiated attributional style that was or was not related to MS in 52 patients with MS to test the LH theory in this population and to determine possible differences between illness-related and non-illness-related attributions. Patients were administered measures of attributional style, daily stressors, disability, and depressive symptoms. Participants were more likely to list non-MS-related than MS-related causes of negative events on the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and more-disabled participants listed significantly more MS-related causes than did less-disabled individuals. Non-MS-related attributional style correlated with stress and depressive symptoms, but MS-related attributional style did not correlate with disability or depressive symptoms. Stress mediated the effect of non-MS-related attributional style on depressive symptoms. These results suggest that, although attributional style appears to be an important construct in MS, it does not seem to be related directly to depressive symptoms; rather, it is related to more perceived stress, which in turn is related to increased depressive symptoms.","['Learned helplessness', 'Attribution', 'Depression (economics)', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Stressor', 'Population', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Clinical psychology', 'Medicine', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'History', 'Environmental health', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Gray Vargas', 'Peter A.

Why do the lonely stay lonely?

Specifically, this study investigated whether attributions and emotions in situations of social inclusion and exclusion differ between chronically lonely adolescents and adolescents with a different loneliness history. A total of 730 adolescents (Mage at Wave 1 = 15.43 years) participated in a 4-wave longitudinal study with annual loneliness assessments. A chronic loneliness trajectory was identified, in addition to low-stable, moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing loneliness trajectories. At Wave 4, vignettes depicting social inclusion and exclusion were presented, and participants rated a set of attributions and emotions following each vignette. Compared with individuals following other trajectories, chronically lonely adolescents were characterized by hypersensitivity to social exclusion (i.e., higher levels of negative emotions) and hyposensitivity to social inclusion (i.e., lower levels of enthusiasm). Further, chronically lonely adolescents had a stronger tendency to attribute social inclusion to circumstantial factors and social exclusion to internal and stable characteristics. This maladaptive attribution style partially mediated their emotional experiences. Together, results indicate that chronically lonely individuals respond to social situations in ways that may perpetuate rather than reduce their loneliness.","['Loneliness', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Vignette', 'Social exclusion', 'Developmental psychology', 'Longitudinal study', 'Inclusion (mineral)', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Economic growth', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']","['Janne Vanhalst', 'Bart Soenens', 'Koen Luyckx', 'Stijn Van Petegem', 'Molly S.

Method A total of 46 out-patients diagnosed with BD, 49 with SZ, and 50 healthy controls were assessed in attributional style (Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire), facial emotion recognition (FEIT, FEDT, ER-40), and ToM (Hinting Task). Symptomatology, clinical variables and global functioning were also collected. Results Both groups with SZ and BD showed hostile social cognitive biases, compared with the control group. Patients with BD also showed a capacity for emotional recognition similar to those with SZ and worse than control subjects. In contrast, patients with SZ showed poorer ToM. Subthreshold depressive symptoms and an attributional style toward hostility appeared as the factors with a strongest association to global functioning in BD. In SZ, PANSS score and a tendency to aggressiveness were the most relevant factors. Conclusion Attributional style (along with other domains of social cognition) is altered in out-patients with BD and SZ. The presence of residual symptoms and a hostile social cognitive bias may contribute to the functional impairment of both groups.","['Hostility', 'Psychology', 'Social cognition', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Theory of mind', 'Attribution', 'Cognition', 'Bipolar disorder', 'Clinical psychology', 'Attribution bias', 'Social functioning', 'Psychiatry', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Distress']","['Guillermo Lahera', 'Sara Herrera', 'María Reinares', 'Adolfo Benito', 'M.

The results demonstrated strong internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and a factor structure that was consistent with theory in both samples. Furthermore, analyses demonstrated adequate evidence of the reliability and validity of several dimensional subscale scores and the composite measures of attributional style for both positive and negative events. These results suggest the utility of the CASI in research testing specific attributional predictions of cognitive theories of depression with the dimensional subscale scores.

"Robert Musil, a war journal, and stylometry: Tackling the issue of short texts in authorship attribution",2018,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy055,20,"Abstract During World War I (WWI), between 1916 and 1917, Robert Musil was the chief editor of the Tiroler Soldaten-Zeitung in Bozen. This activity probably also involved authorship of articles and has posed a philological problem to scholars, who have not been able to attribute with certainty a range of relatively short texts to Musil. With this article, we present a new approach that combines philological research with stylometric methods. Exploration of WWI archives and digitization of historical documents were paired with application of authorship attribution techniques, following extensive evaluation. To build the training set, we adapted the ‘impostors method’ by grouping three ‘distractor authors’ (similar to Musil in terms of style) and three actual candidates for authorship. In the test set, we developed two designs for tackling the issue of text length: a combinatory design, where longer chunks were composed by the juxtaposition of short texts; a simplified design, where the texts for attribution were merged with already attributed texts. Results of our experiment suggest that Musil attribution may be disproved with a high level of confidence for ten texts that were more probably written by a less well-known author, Albert Ritter. We carried out a keyness analysis on the specific words preferred or avoided by the two authors, which not only corroborated the results of the quantitative analysis but also findings from Musil philology. Our study showcases the potentialities of using mixed methods in stylometry.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Philology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Certainty', 'Computer science', 'Literature', 'History', 'Art', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Feminism', 'Social psychology', 'Programming language']","['Simone Rebora', 'J.

After a brief introduction, I will discuss the enormous potential of this paradigm for medieval philology, a field that studies so many texts of unknown or disputed origin. At the same time, it will be stressed that stylometry’s application to medieval texts is currently not without problems: many attribution techniques are still controversial and do not account for the specific nature of medieval text production. Throughout this paper, I will tentatively apply two well-established attribution techniques (principal components analysis and Burrows’s Delta) to a number of case studies in Middle Dutch studies.

"Role of Attributional, Styles and Perceived Control in Control in Social Anxiety Among University Entrants",2017,https://doi.org/10.14204/ejrep.42.16056,10,"Introduction. Social anxiety is a persistent, intense and chronic fear of being negatively judged by others as well as by themselves and being embarrassed by one’s own actions. Attributional styles is known as the way an individual explains positive and negative events in life and it has an important bearing on her well being, motivation and performance. Perceived control refers to the belief that one can determine one’s own internal state and behavior, influence one’s environment, and/or bring about desired outcomes. Socially anxious individuals feel that they lack control over the events affecting them. The present study is carried out to check the relationship of social anxiety with attributional style and perceived control.Method. Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Attributional Style Assessment Testing-I and Perceived Control Scale were administered on 200 female participants from Punjabi University, Patiala. Using correlational design, Pearson's bivariate correlations were performed.Results. The findings showed that there was positive correlation between ability attribution for failure and social anxiety, and negative correlation was found between effort attribution for failure and social anxiety. There was also a negative correlation between interpersonal control, the dimension of perceived control and social anxiety. Regression analysis showed that ability attribution for failure and interpersonal control are significantly predictor of social anxiety.Discussion. The present study was conducted on assessing the relation of social anxiety with attibutional style and perceived control among university entrants. The findings revealed that freshers with high level of social anxiety showed dysfunctional Attributional style and low perceived control than those low on social anxiety.

We also administered Winters and Neale's ( J Abnorm Psychol 1985; 94 : 282–290 ) implicit measure of attributional style. Results: Whereas mean levels of self‐esteem and affect were not abnormal in the remitted bipolar patients, the bipolar patients showed strong fluctuations in these processes.

College students were assessed for individual differences in self-handicapping and attributional style at the beginning of the term. Prior to the first exam they had an opportunity to claim handicaps that might hamper their performance on the exam. After receiving feedback that they had performed poorly on the exam, all students completed measures of mood, self-esteem, and performance attributions. Support for the hypothesis was found for men but not for women. Level of self-handicapping interacted with sex of subject such that high self handicapping among men predicted claimed handicapping prior to the exam and more external attributions for poor performance and higher self-esteem following feedback. Among women, the relations between self-handicapping tendencies and claimed handicaps and performance attributions were weaker than for men. In addition, unlike men's, women's post feedback self-esteem was unrelated to claimed handicaps and performance attributions. Potential mechanisms underlying sex differences in self-handicapping and responses to negative feedback are discussed.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Self-esteem', 'Social psychology', 'Mood', 'Developmental psychology', 'Self-concept']","['Frederick Rhodewalt', 'S.

Beliefs about voices and their effects on coping strategies,2000,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.01375.x,56,"Cognitive behavioural techniques are increasingly used as adjuncts to medication in the treatment of auditory hallucinations for people with schizophrenia. There are now literally hundreds of nurses trained in the use of cognitive behavioural interventions for psychosis. However, there is still disagreement about the nature of the cognitive processes that lead to deficits or biases in patients' processing of information about their psychotic experiences. Using Chadwick & Birchwood's Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire (BAVQ), the investigator collected data regarding voices from a sample of men and women being treated for schizophrenia by secondary mental health services. The investigator then carried out a cross-lagged panel analysis of the data. The investigator found, as predicted, positive relationships between a resistive coping style and an attribution of malevolence to voices, and between an engaging coping style and an attribution of benevolence to voices. Coping and attributional styles were not necessarily stable over time. There was a non-significant difference between women's and men's attributions and coping styles. There was less fluctuation over time in the women's scores on the BAVQ. This research shows that one cannot assume that either coping or attributional style becomes more stable over time. However, while there are strong relationships between attributions and coping styles, and particularly between malevolence and resistance and benevolence and engagement, these relationships are not necessarily mutually exclusive and some people in the study believe their voices to be both malevolent and benevolent. These findings suggest that clinicians need to make a very careful assessment of attribution and coping with regard to hallucinations and that systematic reassessment is very important. Further research is necessary in both the phenomenology of attribution and coping, but also to relate these variables to other aspects of schizophrenic illnesses.","['Attribution', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Psychology', 'Cognition', 'Psychological intervention', 'Mental health', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive style', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Jane M.

Hostile attributions in incarcerated adult male offenders: An exploration of diverse pathways,2005,https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.20050,64,"Hostile attributions were examined in 150 incarcerated males to test the possibility that there are two pathways associated with hostile attributions: one related to psychopathy as assessed using the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised [PCL-R; Hare, 1991] and one related to depressogenic attributional style, as assessed using the Inferential Styles Questionnaire [ISQ; Rose et al., 1994]. Ten hypothetical vignettes were used to assess attributions of intent. Both PCL-R and ISQ scores were significant predictors of hostile attributions. Further, the two processes appeared to relate differentially to the race of the participants, such that an ISQ-hostile attribution association was stronger among African American participants than among Caucasian participants.

Design/methodology/approach Because New Zealand does not require unit trusts to disclose their security holdings, the paper used returns‐based style analysis to infer how these trusts have allocated their funds among asset classes. Findings The research has found that, for unit trusts available to New Zealand investors, asset allocation can explain a significant amount of the differences in return across time and between trusts. Across time, asset allocation accounts for about 80 per cent of the variation in actual return. Between trusts, asset allocation explains about 60 per cent of the variation in returns. From either perspective, the choice of asset allocation is an important factor in explaining returns.

Attributional styles in boys with severe behaviour problems: A possible reason for lack of progress on a positive behaviour programme,1999,https://doi.org/10.1348/000709999157554,10,"Background. The number of exclusions from British schools has been increasing in recent years: the vast majority are because of disruptive behaviour. Increasing the effectiveness of behaviour control is therefore a priority for educators. Aims. This study tests the hypothesis that children who do not respond well to a behaviour modification regime exhibit a depressed attributional style. Sample. The sample comprised 26 boys aged 7‐11 in a special day school for children with behaviour problems. Method. Participants were interviewed about positive and negative aspects of school life: responses were coded using the Leeds Attributional Coding System (Stratton et al. , 1988). School records were then used to identify children making good progress through the Positive Behaviour Programme ( N = 13) and those making little or no progress ( N = 8). Results. Mean proportions of stable, global, internal, personal and controllable attributions were compared by progress group (high/low) and outcome (positive/negative) using mixed‐design ANOVA. High progress children made significantly more global and internal attributions for positive than for negative events, while low progress children made more personal attributions for negative than for positive events. Conclusions. A depressed attributional style may act as a barrier which hinders the generalisation and internalisation of traditional behaviour modification methods. Increased teacher‐awareness of attribution could increase the effectiveness of remedial programmes.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Remedial education', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Sample (material)', 'Social psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Mathematics education', 'Archaeology', 'History', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography']",['Mike Eslea'],0,False,British Journal of Educational Psychology,[]

Text clustering: An application with the <i>State of the Union</i> addresses,2015,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23283,39,"This paper describes a clustering and authorship attribution study over the State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2014 (224 speeches delivered by 41 presidents). To define the style of each presidency, we have applied a principal component analysis ( PCA ) based on the part‐of‐speech ( POS ) frequencies. From R oosevelt (1934), each president tends to own a distinctive style whereas previous presidents tend usually to share some stylistic aspects with others. Applying an automatic classification based on the frequencies of all content‐bearing word‐types we show that chronology tends to play a central role in forming clusters, a factor that is more important than political affiliation. Using the 300 most frequent word‐types, we generate another clustering representation based on the style of each president. This second view shares similarities with the first one, but usually with more numerous and smaller clusters. Finally, an authorship attribution approach for each speech can reach a success rate of around 95.7% under some constraints. When an incorrect assignment is detected, the proposed author often belongs to the same party and has lived during roughly the same time period as the presumed author.

Further, since an important component of transformational leadership is the leader's ability to create a consensus or a similar mindset among subordinates, attributions that the leader is transformational are likely to depend on both the leader's behaviours and the extent to which subordinates perceive the leader similarly. In the present study, these notions were tested using a multi‐source data set comprising 68 focal managers, 285 subordinates, 495 peers, and 68 supervisors. Results indicated that leaders who engage in higher levels of appropriate leader behaviours are more likely to have followers who agree in their perceptions of the leader. In addition, significant interactions were found between leader behaviours and agreement among subordinates, suggesting that agreement moderates the relationship between leader behaviours and attributions of transformational leadership style.","['Transformational leadership', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Attribution', 'Mindset', 'Transactional leadership', 'Perception', 'Leadership style', 'Shared leadership', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Neuroscience', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['Barbara Feinberg', 'Cheri Ostroff', 'W.

In the current study, this alternative model was tested by using LISREL to reanalyze the Alfano et al. data. Results showed that this third model, with shyness as the mediating variable, fit the model quite poorly, in contrast to the preferred model of Alfano et al., which fit quite well.

The promises and perils of mining git,2009,https://doi.org/10.1109/msr.2009.5069475,305,"We are now witnessing the rapid growth of decentralized source code management (DSCM) systems, in which every developer has her own repository.

Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as ldquoHow do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?rdquo However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion.

Data support the conclusion that attributional explanatory style does relate to the perceived outcomes of a failed venture, specifically, the four areas of risk identified by Liles (1974) as being influenced by the entrepreneurial startup—financial well-being, career opportunities, family relations, and self-esteem. Because of the possible difficulty in abstracting singular causal relationship concerning attribution, overall explanatory style may be more influential for how individuals interpret events and behaviors and make causal explanations for answering why things happen. In this study, an overall explanatory style of external, unstable, specific, and uncontrollable attributions was associated with more positive perceived outcomes related to all the four areas of risk in the context of a failed entrepreneurial venture.","['Attribution', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Explanatory model', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Finance', 'Business', 'Epistemology', 'Archaeology', 'Biology', 'History', 'Paleontology', 'Philosophy']","['Mary K.

"Daily diaries and minority adolescents: Random coefficient regression modeling of attributional style, coping, and affect",2009,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207590802644758,11,"Many researchers underscore the importance of coping in the daily lives of adolescents, yet very few studies measure this and related constructs at this level. Using a daily diary approach to stress and coping, the current study evaluated a series of mediational coping models in a sample of low-income minority adolescents (N = 89). Specifically, coping was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between attributional style (and dimensions) and daily affect. Using random coefficient regression modeling, the relationship between (a) the locus of causality dimension and positive affect was completely mediated by the use of acceptance and humor as coping strategies; (b) the stability dimension and positive affect was completely mediated by the use of both problem-solving and positive thinking; and (c) the stability dimension and negative affect was partially mediated by the use of religious coping. In addition, the locus of causality and stability (but not globality) dimensions were also directly related to affect. However, the relationship between pessimistic explanatory style and affect was not mediated by coping. Consistent with previous research, these findings suggest that attributions are both directly and indirectly related to indices of affect or adjustment. Thus, attributions may not only influence the type of coping strategy employed, but may also serve as coping strategies themselves.","['Psychology', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Attribution', 'Multilevel model', 'Globality', 'Social psychology', 'Pessimism', 'Developmental psychology', 'Locus of control', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Statistics', 'Communication', 'Epistemology', 'Economics', 'Market economy', 'Globalization', 'Mathematics', 'Philosophy']","['Scott C.

Attributional style, defined as the way in which people explain events (Abramson, Seligman, &amp; Teasdale, 1978), is represented by three dimensions: permanence, pervasiveness, and personalisation. Statistically significant differences were observed between attributional style for gender and academic streams. Females were more optimistic and hopeful than males. They attributed permanence to good events, but assumed personal responsibility for bad events. Males displayed a more negative attributional style, perceiving negative events as permanent and pervasive. Higher-ability students reported greater optimism about their future compared to their lower-ability students. No gender and ability differences were found for academic self-efficacy. Students’ attributional style was positively associated with their efficacy for self-regulated learning.

The subjects were 99 seventh-grade students (56 male and 43 female), from public schools in Sooke, Canada, who were selected randomly to participate in this study. A model was tested, using AMOS software. The scales used consisted of modified Stipek s (1993), Attribution for Performance in Math, Self-Efficacy Scale, the Foundation Skills Assessment tests and Lock and Bryan (1968) modified Students Grade Goals Rating Scale. The results showed that the model was statistically fit and that student s math selfefficacy was influenced by his/her attribution. A significant relationship was found between self-efficacy and internal attribution. Also, the path between math selfefficacy and goal setting was significant, implying that self-efficacy plays a key role in students goal setting. In addition, the students goal setting was a predictor of the math achievement. Actually, those students who set higher goals for themselves in mathematics get better grades in math. The effect of self-efficacy on math achievement was indirect, through goal setting. The significant path between the attribution and math achievement shows that the explanatory styles influence math achievement. In other words, those students who attribute the causes of their success in math to internal factors receive higher grades, and those students who attribute the causes of their failure in math to internal factors get lower grades in mathematics.","['Attribution', 'Self-efficacy', 'Scale (ratio)', 'Mathematics education', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Psychology', 'Path analysis (statistics)', 'Need for achievement', 'Social psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Computer science', 'Statistics', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Programming language']","['M Shehni Yailagh', 'John Wills Lloyd', 'John Walsh']",41,False,,[]

We theorize that serial entrepreneurs whose previous venture failed are likely to blame the external environment and change industries for their subsequent venture, and that this industry change is costly in that it invalidates potentially useful industry experience, thereby hindering their subsequent venture. In contrast, founders of failed ventures are unlikely to change aspects of their previous business (when starting their subsequent venture) that would be attributable to their leadership—that is, strategy, decision-making, and planning style.

In light of the motivational component of hope theory, initiating and sustaining effort toward goals (i.e., agency), we were interested in hope's relation to constructs addressing self-esteem, familial functioning, and stress. Two hundred, fifty-two parents of children with externalizing disorders completed self-report questionnaires. Significant associations were found among hope and parental and familial functioning indices (e.g., warm and nurturing parenting styles, cohesive and active family environment, adaptive coping strategies). Considering their conceptual overlap, we tested the unique predictive power of hope and optimistic attributions on indices of psychological functioning. Separate regressions indicated that hope significantly predicted psychological functioning beyond what was accounted for by social desirability, the severity of child symptoms, and optimistic attributions. Hope agency compared to hope pathways (i.e., perceived ability to generate strategies to obtain goals) accounted for the vast amount of variance in regression models. In contrast, optimistic attributions failed to predict any of the variables of interest.

No study to date has examined the relations between these 3 reasoning anomalies in the same individuals so as to evaluate their functional independence and potentially inform theories of delusion formation. We did so in 35 schizophrenic patients with a history of delusions, 30 of whom were currently deluded, and 34 healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed (a) a jumping-to-conclusions bias and a bias to overadjust when confronted with a change of evidence on probabilistic-reasoning tasks, (b) an excessive externalizing attributional bias, and (c) performance deficits on 3 ToM tasks. Probabilistic-reasoning and ToM measures correlated, while attributional-bias scores were independent of other task measures. A general proneness to delusional ideation correlated with probabilistic-reasoning and ToM measures, while externalizing bias was unrelated to the study measures of delusional ideation. Personalizing bias associated specifically with paranoia across the clinical and nonclinical participants. Findings are consistent with a common underlying mechanism in schizophrenia which contributes to the anomalies on probabilistic-reasoning and ToM tasks associated with delusions.

Major results indicated that type of school attended did have consequences in terms of adolescents' stated preferences and rated achievement in subjects. Students attending co‐educational school were found to have more traditional subject preferences and assessments of achievement in those subject areas than students attending single‐sex schools. Students attending co‐educational schools were also found to have lower self esteem, and greater affiliation with peers than students from single‐sex schools. However, these relationships were not simple. Sex differences mediated the major associations reported between type of school attended and adolescent self perceptions. Interpretations of these and other results and suggestions for further exploration of associations are given.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Locus of control', 'Single sex', 'Developmental psychology', 'Perception', 'Social psychology', 'Self-esteem', 'Academic achievement', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Mathematics education', 'Neuroscience', 'Communication']",['Anne E.

Multiple Facets of Self-Esteem and their Relations to Depressive Symptoms,1998,https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167298246009,189,"The authors examined whether stability and level of self-esteem interact with daily hassles in predicting severity of depressive symptoms. As predicted, Time 2 depression scores (with Time 1 scores controlled) were highest among individuals with unstable self-esteem who reported considerable daily hassles. By contrast, self-esteem level did not interact with daily hassles to predict Time 2 depressive symptoms. These findings held even after negative self-concept items were eliminated from the depressive symptom inventories. Additional analyses revealed that self-esteem stability accounted for variance independent of the tendency to over generalize following failure or negative event attributional style. These findings support the contention that unstable self-esteem reflects fragile feelings of self-worth that exacerbate depressive symptoms under certain circumstances.","['Psychology', 'Self-esteem', 'Attribution', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Feeling', 'Depression (economics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Cognition', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Michael H.

Attributing minds to vampires in Richard Matheson’s<i>I Am Legend</i>,2015,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963947014561834,71,"For Palmer (2004, 2010), and other proponents of a cognitive narratology, research into real-world minds in the cognitive sciences provides insights into readers’ experiences of fictional minds. In this article, I explore the application of such research to the minds constructed for the vampire characters in Richard Matheson’s 1954 science fiction/horror novel I Am Legend. I draw upon empirical research into ‘mind attribution’ in social psychology, and apply Cognitive Grammar (Langacker, 2008), and its notion of ‘construal’, as a framework for the application of such findings to narrative. In my analysis, I suggest that readers’ attribution of mental-states to the vampires in Matheson’s novel is strategically limited through a number of choices in their linguistic construal. Drawing on online reader responses to the novel, I argue that readers’ understanding of these other minds plays an important role in their empathetic experience and ethical judgement of the novel’s main character and focaliser, Robert Neville. Finally, I suggest that the limited mind attribution for the vampires invited through their construal contributes to the presentation of a ‘mind style’ (Fowler, 1977) for this character.","['Construal level theory', 'Psychology', 'Narratology', 'Attribution', 'Narrative', 'Vampire', 'Cognitive grammar', 'Judgement', 'Cognitive linguistics', 'Cognition', 'Epistemology', 'Social psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Neuroscience']",['Louise Nuttall'],50,False,Language and Literature International Journal of Stylistics,[]

Attributions for the particular examination performance were predictive of depressed mood for students who were disappointed in their examination performance. Few subjects, 31%, gave attributions in response to the indirect probe, and there was no support for the prediction that unexpected negative events would lead to subjects' making more attributions.

De‐anonymizing Ethereum blockchain smart contracts through code attribution,2020,https://doi.org/10.1002/nem.2130,22,"Summary Blockchain users are identified by addresses (public keys), which cannot be easily linked back to them without out‐of‐network information. This provides pseudo‐anonymity, which is amplified when the user generates a new address for each transaction. Since all transaction history is visible to all users in public blockchains, finding affiliation between related addresses undermines pseudo‐anonymity. Such affiliation information can be used to discriminate against addresses linked with undesired activities or can lead to de‐anonymization if out‐of‐network information becomes available. In this work, we propose an approach to undermine pseudo‐anonymity of blockchain transactions by linking together addresses that were used to deploy smart contracts, which were produced by the same authors. In our approach, we leverage stylometry techniques, widely used in the social science field for attribution of literary texts to their corresponding authors. The assumption underlying authorship attribution is the existence of a distinctive writing style, unique to an author and easily distinguishable from others. Drawing an analogy between literary text and smart contracts' source code, we explore the extent to which unique features of source code and byte code of Ethereum smart contracts can represent the coding style of smart contract developers. We show that even a small number of representative features leads to a sufficiently high accuracy in attributing smart contracts' code to its deployer's address. We further validate our approach on real‐world scammers' data and Ponzi scheme‐related contracts. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to extract distinctly contributing features per an entire dataset or per specific authors.

A Girl Has No Name: Automated Authorship Obfuscation using Mutant-X,2019,https://doi.org/10.2478/popets-2019-0058,25,"Abstract Stylometric authorship attribution aims to identify an anonymous or disputed document’s author by examining its writing style. The development of powerful machine learning based stylometric authorship attribution methods presents a serious privacy threat for individuals such as journalists and activists who wish to publish anonymously. Researchers have proposed several authorship obfuscation approaches that try to make appropriate changes (e.g. word/phrase replacements) to evade attribution while preserving semantics. Unfortunately, existing authorship obfuscation approaches are lacking because they either require some manual effort, require significant training data, or do not work for long documents. To address these limitations, we propose a genetic algorithm based random search framework called M utant -X which can automatically obfuscate text to successfully evade attribution while keeping the semantics of the obfuscated text similar to the original text. Specifically, M utant -X sequentially makes changes in the text using mutation and crossover techniques while being guided by a fitness function that takes into account both attribution probability and semantic relevance. While M utant -X requires black-box knowledge of the adversary’s classifier, it does not require any additional training data and also works on documents of any length. We evaluate M utant -X against a variety of authorship attribution methods on two different text corpora. Our results show that M utant -X can decrease the accuracy of state-of-the-art authorship attribution methods by as much as 64% while preserving the semantics much better than existing automated authorship obfuscation approaches. While M utant -X advances the state-of-the-art in automated authorship obfuscation, we find that it does not generalize to a stronger threat model where the adversary uses a different attribution classifier than what M utant -X assumes.

Prospective Models of Depressive Symptoms in Early Adolescence,1995,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272431695015003002,59,"Models of depressive symptoms were compared in a 6-month prospective study of 95 nonreferred 11- to 13-year-olds. Maladaptive attributional style and social support correlated with multiple measures of concurrent depressive symptoms. Life stress generally failed to correlate with concurrent depressive symptoms. Prospectively, attribution style failed to predict depressive symptoms, whereas social support predicted mother, but not self-, ratings of depressive symptoms. The interaction between attributional style and subsequent life stress generally failed to predict future depressive symptoms. Limited specificity was found in that risk factors correlated similarly with depressive symptoms and aggressive behaviors. Findings showed that attributional style was primarily a concomitant of depressive symptoms in the present sample, although length of follow-up and age need to be considered when testing the temporal relationships posited by causal attributional style models.

Attributions for real and hypothetical events: Their relation to self-esteem and depression.,1985,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-843x.94.4.530,59,"The association between attributional style, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and general distress was examined to test hypotheses derived from a learned helplessness model and Weiner's (1979) attributional model of motivation. After answering questionnaires on depression, general distress, and self-esteem, 178 male and female undergraduate students were asked to make causal attributional ratings about 12 hypothetical events; 151 subjects also were asked to make diary ratings on 14 real events. Results revealed that attributional ratings were internally consistent across events; however, attributions about positive outcomes were either uncorrelated or positively correlated with attributions about negative outcomes, failing to support learned helplessness predictions that a single process underlies attributions about positive and negative events. As predicted, internal attributions for positive outcomes were primarily associated with high self-esteem. Only internal stable attributions for negative outcomes were related to depressive symptoms, consistent with Weiner's model. The pattern of correlation between attributions and general distress was essentially identical to that obtained with depressive symptoms.

Gender Attribution: Tracing Stylometric Evidence Beyond Topic and Genre,2011,,106,"Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973)) postulate that women's language styles differ from that of men. In this paper, we explore statistical techniques that can learn to identify the gender of authors in modern English text, such as web blogs and scientific papers. Although recent work has shown the efficacy of statistical approaches to gender attribution, we conjecture that the reported performance might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic factors such as topic bias in gender that can make the gender detection task easier. Our work is the first that consciously avoids gender bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evidence to gender-specific styles in language beyond topic. In addition, our comparative study provides new insights into robustness of various stylometric techniques across topic and genre.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Gender bias', 'Robustness (evolution)', 'Tracing', 'Task (project management)', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Gene', 'Operating system']","['Ruchita Sarawgi', 'Kailash Gajulapalli', 'Yejin Choi']",21,False,Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,[]
How Theory X style of management arose from a fundamental attribution error,2015,https://doi.org/10.1108/jmh-03-2014-0073,9,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose that the Theory X style of management arose from a fundamental attribution error, in which managers assumed that employees’ lack of motivation was a disposition rather than a function of unmotivating work situations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews the nature of work during the industrial revolution from a Job Characteristics Model perspective and compares Theory X and Theory Y perspectives in terms of their emphasis on dispositional or situational influences on behavior. Findings – It was found that factory work performed during the industrial revolution was likely to be deficient in terms of the five core dimensions of the Job Characteristics Model, and would have been unmotivating. Because of the fundamental attribution error, managers would have assumed that workers were unmotivated by nature, but the situation was likely the cause of their lack of motivation. Practical implications – As illustrated by our findings, management theory development and interpretation can benefit from understanding the historical context within which the theory was developed. Considering both situational and person (i.e. individual differences or traits) effects is particularly important for theory development. Originality/value – The unique contribution of this paper is to make the connection between the characteristics of work performed during the industrial revolution and consequent inaccurate managerial attributions of worker motivation (i.e. Theory X).","['Situational ethics', 'Attribution', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Value (mathematics)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Function (biology)', 'Interpretation (philosophy)', 'Originality', 'Social psychology', 'Psychology', 'Management styles', 'Epistemology', 'Sociology', 'Management', 'Computer science', 'Economics', 'Paleontology', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'Machine learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Biology', 'Creativity', 'History', 'Programming language']","['H.

The vicissitudes of attitudes and similar representational constructs in twentieth century psychology,1986,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2420160202,210,"Abstract ‘Attitudes’ has been the central concept of social psychology in three different periods, over which the interest evolved to three progressively more sophisticated topics. The first of these three peakings was the 1920s and 1930s preoccupation with the static topics of attitude scaling and relation to behaviour. Then, after a 1935–1955 interlude in which the study of group processes supplanted attitude as the central concern of social psychology, attitude research re‐emerged as the dominant interest during the 1950s and 1960s enthusiasm for the dynamic topic of attitude change, approached by a convergent style in the 1950s and a divergent style in the 1960s. During the 1965–1985 period interest shifted from attitudes to social cognition, including representational reductions in information encoding and decoding as well as inferential extrapolations in meaning attribution, person perception, and cognitive ramifications. Now we are experiencing the beginnings of a third flourishing of attitude research likely to dominate the 1980s and 1990s, this third peaking focused on more evolved structural issues, including the structure of individual attitudes, of systems of attitudes, and of attitudinal systems as they relate to other systems within the person.

Methods The investigation included 62 subjects. The first group consisted of 32 patients with endogenous depression in remission. The second group included 30 healthy subjects. The characteristics of attribution style, in both groups, were tested by the Attribution Style Questionnaire (ASQ). Results The group of depressive patients, in comparison with healthy subjects, exhibited a significantly more marked internal attribution for negative events (t(60)=-3.700; p&lt;0.01) and global internal negative attributions (t(60)=-4.023; p&lt;0.01).

The Inevitability of Future Suffering: The Role of Depressive Predictive Certainty in Depression,1990,https://doi.org/10.1521/soco.1990.8.2.203,84,"Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that depressed individuals not only make pessimistic predictions about the future, but also do so with considerably more certainty than do nondepressed or mildly depressed individuals. The notion of depressive predictive certainty is introduced as a means of conceptualizing hopelessness, because one should ""give up"" hope when the occurrence of dreaded events and the nonoccurrence of desired events seem inevitable. Study 1 examined the manner in which a sample of college students made predictions about positive and negative future events that might happen to them. Increasing depression (as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory; BDI) was associated both with depressive pessimism (estimating that negative events are likely and that positive events are not) and with certainty in making these pessimistic predictions. Such certainty was uniquely associated with depression, even when the simple perceived likelihood of the events (and even generalized hopelessness as measured by the Beck scale) was considered. Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1, and extended them, by contrasting the role of depressive predictive certainty in depression with the role of depressive attributional style and the recent occurrence of negative life events. Depressive predictive certainty was again reliably and uniquely associated with depression, even when negative life events and attributional style were included in the equation.

However insight into illness has not been empirically investigated in ASP and little research has examined how individuals with ASP view their deficits. This is the first study to assess insight and the relationship between insight and externalizing bias (EB) in ASP. Participants with ASP (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 24) were recruited. Attributional style was assessed with the internal, personal, and situational attribution questionnaire. Insight was assessed with both a clinician-administered and a self-administered measure. Results revealed that EB was negatively correlated with insight as assessed with the clinician-administered but not the self-administered measure of insight.","['Psychology', 'Asperger syndrome', 'Autism', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Public health', 'Psychiatry', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Nursing', 'Archaeology', 'History']","['Nyaz Didehbani', 'Mujeeb U.

"The interplay of self-acceptance, social comparison and attributional style in adolescent mental health: cross-sectional study",2023,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2023.594,9,"Background Adolescence is a pivotal stage vulnerable to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Although self-acceptance and social comparison are known to affect adolescent mental health, their interactive and moderating roles are not fully understood. Aims To explore the role of self-acceptance, social comparison and attributional style in predicting these mental health outcomes among adolescents in clinical settings. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 242 adolescents. Participants completed measures assessing self-acceptance, social comparison, attributional style and mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety). Mediation models and multi-group analysis were used to examine the relationships among these variables. Results Our findings demonstrated a significant relationship between self-acceptance, social comparison, depression and anxiety ( r s = 0.32–0.88). Specifically, lower self-acceptance and higher social comparison were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Additionally, individuals with external attributional tendencies reported higher depression (Cohen's d = 0.61) and anxiety ( d = 0.58) compared with those with internal tendencies. Mediation modelling showed that social comparison is a mediator between self-acceptance and depression (effect size −0.04, 95% CI −0.08 to −0.01) and anxiety (effect size −0.06, 95% CI −0.10 to −0.02). Crucially, multi-group analysis showed that the impact of social comparison on mental health outcomes varied significantly based on attributional style. Conclusions These findings underscore the importance of considering self-acceptance, social comparison and attributional style in understanding and addressing mental health challenges during adolescence. This could inform the development of targeted interventions to promote mental health and well-being among adolescents. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings in diverse populations and to exp","['Psychology', 'Mental health', 'Mediation', 'Anxiety', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social anxiety', 'Depression (economics)', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Attribution', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Social support', 'Cross-sectional study', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Communication', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics', 'Pathology']","['Qian-Nan Ruan', 'Guanghui Shen', 'Jiang-Shun Yang', 'Wen‐Jing Yan']",40,True,BJPsych Open,"['Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China']"
"Corpus Stylistics, Stylometry, and the Styles of Henry James",2007,,85,"1. Introduction They would dine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old Waymarsh--if not even, for that matter, to himself--there was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other. The beginning of Henry James's The Ambassadors is sufficient to explain why There has never been any doubt that he had a 'style' (Lodge 189). And the obvious artifice of sentences like the one above, from its famous first paragraph, have helped to establish James as an exceptionally self-conscious stylist. Furthermore, although change must be expected in the style of any author with a career spanning forty years, the stylistic differences between James's novels of the 1870's and those written after 1900 have long been considered extreme. Shortly after James' s death, Carl Van Doren asserted that the style of early novels like The American, The Europeans, Daisy Miller, Washington Square, or The Portrait of a Lady is quite different from the obscure late style that some readers dislike (18). Traditionally, the distinctiveness of James's late style has been attributed primarily to his sometimes convoluted and self-interruptive syntax. R. W. Short notes that James's syntactic distortions often obliterate the normal elements of connection and cohesion. When he has undone the usual ties, his meanings float untethered, grammatically speaking, like particles in colloidal suspension (73-4). Ian Watt's well-known explication of the first paragraph of The Ambassadors also memorably discusses the syntax (442-55), as do Richard Ohmann (274-5), and Leech and Short (100-1) (see also my Altered Texts 110-13). Other critics have pointed out some non-syntactic alterations James made in his revisions of his early novels for New York edition; for example, more explicit and precise lexis, more figures of speech, more varied and. elaborate speech markers, more contractions and colloquialisms, and more adverbial modifiers. These alterations, as well as syntactic changes","['Style (visual arts)', 'Paragraph', 'Literature', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Art history', 'Law', 'Political science']",['David L.

An evaluation of authorship attribution using random forests,2015,https://doi.org/10.1109/ictrc.2015.7156423,18,"Electronic text (e-text) stylometry aims at identifying the writing style of authors of electronic texts, such as electronic documents, blog posts, tweets, etc. Identifying such styles is quite attractive for identifying authors of disputed e-text, identifying their profile attributes (e.g. gender, age group, etc), or even enhancing services such as search engines and recommender systems. Despite the success of Random Forests, its performance has not been evaluated on Author Attribtion problems. In this paper, we present an evaluation of Random Forests in the problem domain of Authorship Attribution. Additionally, we have taken advantage of Random Forests' robustness against noisy features by extracting a diverse set of features from evaluated e-texts.

One way to answer that question is through attributions. The purpose of this study was to examine subjective attribution theories for HIV (internal/self-blame, external/blaming others, and fatalistic) and their association with coping styles and psychological functioning among 57 self-defined gay men who were HIV-positive. None of the respondents were diagnosed with AIDS. Although all men made attributions for their HIV infection, few had incorporated exclusively self-blame and external attributions, respectively. About one-third of the gay men attributed HIV to both self-blame and external factors. Self-blame attribution was associated with the avoidant coping style. Analyses yielded that both self-blame attribution and the avoidant coping style correlated with depressive mood and life dissatisfaction. External attribution theory displayed a positive relation to depressive mood. No particular HIV attribution theory was tied to good psychological functioning.

Fifty-six sexually abused adolescents were seen at the time of abuse discovery and 1 year later. Higher self-blame attributional style for the abuse was related to more satisfaction with other-sex friends and less satisfaction with same-sex friends. More shame was related to less satisfaction with same-sex friends and to having a larger number of other-sex friends. Higher self-blame attributional style was related to perceptions of poorer peer acceptance and close friendship and to perceptions of poorer romantic appeal. More shame was related to lower perceptions of peer acceptance and close friendship. The results support the idea that abuse victims who experience higher levels of shame and self-blame attributional style feel less capable of forming satisfying relationships with peers, friends, and potential romantic partners.","['Shame', 'Friendship', 'Psychology', 'Blame', 'Social psychology', 'Sexual abuse', 'Romance', 'Developmental psychology', 'Perception', 'Peer group', 'Competence (human resources)', 'Poison control', 'Suicide prevention', 'Medicine', 'Environmental health', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychoanalysis']","['Candice Feiring', 'Saul H.

Cold marine indicators of the late Quaternary: the new dinoflagellate cyst genus <i>Islandinium</i> and related morphotypes,2001,https://doi.org/10.1002/jqs.657,206,"Abstract Round, brown, spiny dinoflagellate cysts characterise many modern high‐latitude assemblages. Abundance is often highest where summer sea‐surface temperatures seldom exceed 7 °C and where winter sea‐surface temperatures are around 0 °C, making this morphological group important for reconstructing cold intervals within marine Quaternary sequences. Our analysis of modern sediments from the Beaufort Sea of Arctic Canada, the Kara and Laptev seas of Arctic Russia, and across the Arctic Ocean, allows us to recognise the new cyst genus Islandinium along with the extant species Islandinium minutum (Harland and Reid in Harland et al ., 1980 ) new combination (basionym: Multispinula? minuta ), Islandinium? cezare (de Vernal et al ., 1989 ex de Vernal in Rochon et al ., 1999) new status and combination (basionym: Multispinula? minuta var. cezare ) sensu lato , and Echinidinium karaense new species. Of these, the generotype Islandinium minutum is a well‐known but morphologically problematic species. We have re‐examined the type material from the Beaufort Sea and studied specimens from across the Arctic, and our observations clarify ambiguities in the original description of this species. The archeopyle of Islandinium minutum results from the loss of three apical plates, an unusual style among peridiniphycidean dinoflagellates. The asymmetrical location of these plates around the apex is distinctive, and probably contributed to earlier misunderstandings of the archeopyle. Previous attributions to Multispinula? and Algidasphaeridium? are unsustainable. Maps showing the distribution of Islandinium minutum are given for the Northern Hemisphere and show this species to be polar to north‐temperate, whereas Islandinium? cezare s.l. and Echinidinium karaense appear to be more restricted to polar environments.

AUTOGEN: A Personalized Large Language Model for Academic Enhancement—Ethics and Proof of Principle,2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2023.2233356,50,"In this article, we explore the potential of enhancing academic prose and idea generation by fine-tuning a large language model (here, GPT-3) on one's own previously published writings: AUTOGEN (""AI Unique Tailored Output GENerator""). We develop, test, and describe three distinct AUTOGEN models trained on the prior scholarly output of three of the current authors (SBM, BDE, JS), with a fourth model trained on the combined works of all three. Our AUTOGEN models demonstrate greater variance in quality than the base GPT-3 model, with many outputs outperforming the base model in format, style, overall quality, and novel idea generation. As proof of principle, we present and discuss examples of AUTOGEN-written sections of existing and hypothetical research papers. We further discuss ethical opportunities, concerns, and open questions associated with personalized academic prose and idea generators. Ethical opportunities for personalized LLMs such as AUTOGEN include increased productivity, preservation of writing styles and cultural traditions, and aiding consensus building. However, ethical concerns arise due to the potential for personalized LLMs to reduce output diversity, violate privacy and intellectual property rights, and facilitate plagiarism or fraud. The use of coauthored or multiple-source trained models further complicates issues surrounding ownership and attribution. Open questions concern a potential credit-blame asymmetry for LLM outputs, the legitimacy of licensing agreements in authorship ascription, and the ethical implications of coauthorship attribution for data contributors. Ensuring the output is sufficiently distinct from the source material is crucial to maintaining ethical standards in academic writing. These opportunities, risks, and open issues highlight the intricate ethical landscape surrounding the use of personalized LLMs in academia.

The shared variance between shame–proneness and guilt–proneness and the unique component of shame–proneness were related to both psychological and somatization symptoms, whereas the unique component of guilt–proneness was not related to these measures. Further, increased shame–proneness was associated with making depressogenic attributions, whereas guilt–proneness was not. Concealment was found to mediate the relationship between shame–proneness and psychological symptoms. These findings provide further evidence that the association between guilt and symptoms is accounted for by shame.

Big data or not enough? Zeta test reliability and the attribution of <i>Henry VI</i>,2020,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqaa041,16,"Abstract In 2016, the editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare announced that certain Shakespeare plays could be attributed to co-authors, and certain anonymous plays to Shakespeare, on the basis of non-traditional attribution methods known collectively as computational stylistics, or stylometry. This article investigates the efficacy of a key algorithm used to attribute parts of the Henry VI plays to Christopher Marlowe, the Zeta method invented by John Burrows and adapted by Hugh Craig. Zeta, a test widely used in computational stylistics, is described by Gabriel Egan as ‘by some way the most powerful general-purpose authorship tool currently available’. This article offers extensive independent testing of Zeta. Following criticism of the existing method of Zeta analysis, this article introduces a new, statistically sound method for analysing Zeta results. It investigates a claim that the test is 99.9% reliable in differentiating Shakespeare’s style from Marlowe’s. Examining the conditions under which certain authors were ruled in or out of co-authorship of the Henry VI plays, it determines the effect of disparity in data set size on Zeta’s reliability, as well the effect of small data sets. Several test results confirm that Zeta is unduly influenced by genre. The article concludes that in the light of this study, the small canons of most Early Modern dramatists, particularly where they are genre-skewed like Marlowe’s, do not provide enough data for Zeta to be reliable","['Stylometry', 'Criticism', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Variance (accounting)', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics education', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Physics', 'Paleontology', 'Power (physics)', 'Accounting', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Biology', 'Business']",['R.

As expected, the tendency to attribute negative events to internal, stable and global causes predicted higher psychological distress. There was also a positive association between extent of victimisation and psychological distress. Although attributional style did not mediate in this relationship, there was evidence of moderation.

Attributions and behaviours of parents abused as children: a mediational analysis of the intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment (Part II),2004,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00340.x,138,"This study extends previous research (Dixon, Browne, & Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2004) by exploring the mediational properties of parenting styles and their relation to risk factors in the intergenerational cycle of child maltreatment. Families with newborns where at least one of the parents was physically and/or sexually abused as a child (AP families) were compared, in terms of parents' attributions and behaviour, to families where the parents had no childhood history of victimization (NAP families).Information was collected from 4351 families (135 AP families) by community nurses as part of the 'health visiting' service. The same health visitor visited each family twice at home when the child was 4 to 6 weeks and 3 to 5 months of age, to assess behavioural indicators of positive parenting.Within 13 months after birth, 9 (6.7%) AP families were referred for maltreating their own child in comparison to 18 (.4%) NAP families. Assessments found a significantly higher number of risk factors and measures indicating poor parenting for AP families. Mediational analysis found that intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment was explained to a larger extent (62% of the total effect) by the presence of poor parenting styles together with the three significant risk factors (parenting under 21 years, history of mental illness or depression, residing with a violent adult). The three risk factors alone were less explanatory (53% of the total effect).This study provides an explanation for why a minority of parents abused in childhood go on to maltreat their own infant, evidencing poor parenting styles and mediating risk factors. Hence, prevention may be enhanced in AP families by the promotion of 'positive parenting' in addition to providing additional support to young parents, tackling mental illness/depression and domestic violence problems.","['Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Attribution', 'Parenting styles', 'Mental health', 'Child abuse', 'Injury prevention', 'Poison control', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Medicine', 'Environmental health']","['Louise Dixon', 'Catherine Hamilton‐Giachritsis', 'Kevin D.

Conceptual and empirical challenges to the “authentic” versus “hubristic” model of pride.,2013,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0031711,107,"An increasingly influential perspective in the study of pride holds that there are two distinct facets characterized by distinct ways of appraising the causes of achievement. ""Authentic Pride"" has been characterized as attributing success to one's temporary effort, whereas ""Hubristic Pride"" purportedly attributes success to one's stable, innate ability. In four studies, we present evidence against both predicted attributional profiles, and demonstrate that the Hubristic Pride Scale does not measure feelings of pride at all, but rather measures acknowledgment that one has displayed pride in an excessive manner. In Studies 1a and 1b, perceptions of not genuinely meriting credit for successes significantly mediated Hubristic Pride ratings; in Study 2, Hubristic Pride scores correlated with sensitivity to social evaluations of oneself, and in Study 3, Hubristic Pride scores correlated with perceptions of oneself as undeserving of true credit for success. Across studies, Hubristic Pride scores were repeatedly uncorrelated with causal attributions of success to effort, personal ability, stable traits, or the actions of the self, but positively correlated with appraisals of personal shortcomings along these dimensions as causing failure. In contrast to this self-deprecating appraisal style, Authentic Pride scores predicted attributions of success to effort, ability, stable traits, and the self, but negatively correlated with appraisals of the causes of failures. Although our results are incompatible with the Authentic and Hubristic model of pride as previously formulated and measured, we advocate, on evolutionary grounds, for continued inquiry into the prospective two-facet structure of pride using improved instruments.","['Pride', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Feeling', 'Perception', 'Scale (ratio)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience', 'Political science', 'Law']","['Colin Holbrook', 'Jared Piazza', 'Daniel M.

This research examines how a newly assigned team leader's status moderates subordinates' reactions to different leadership styles to affect assessments of the leader's self-confidence and effectiveness, and how this impacts team performance. Across 2 experimental studies, results demonstrate that low-status leaders are rated as more effective when they use a directive style, whereas high-status leaders are viewed as more effective when they use a participative style, and this relationship is mediated by perceptions of self-confidence. In addition, teams whose leaders are viewed more favorably perform better on a complex group task. These findings imply that low-status individuals are able to enhance their level of personal power by drawing on whatever positional power they hold, whereas high-status individuals are better off relying solely on their personal power to influence others.

Data were collected using the Ambiguous Intention Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ), the attributional style interview schedule, and the sociodemographic/clinical data sheet. Participants' scores on the AIHQ varied significantly between different situations (intentional, accidental, and ambiguous). The attributional style of the studied participants regarding their perceived psychosocial problems tended to be related to specific causes. These causes were mostly externally attributed to other people and to circumstances, and were perceived not to persist in the future. It would seem that Egyptians with schizophrenia tend to blame other people for negative events if these events are perceived to cause intentional harm.","['Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'MEDLINE', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Art', 'Literature', 'Political science', 'Law']","['Mayar Elnakeeb', 'Samia M.

"The use of textual, grammatical and sociolinguistic evidence in forensic text comparison:",2011,https://doi.org/10.1558/ijsll.v17i2.211,52,"This article suggests the usefulness of the concept of ‘idiolectal style’ in forensic text comparison and presents evidence that was used by the defence in a forensic authorship attribution case to show that the author of four non-disputed faxes could also be the author of four disputed emails, both sets written in Spanish. Apart from qualitative textual analysis, two different quantitative approaches were undertaken: a) the use of the concepts of markedness and saliency in order to establish the rarity in the frequency and use of two grammatical variables - by comparing their behaviour to the one observed in a general corpus - indicated in both data sets the favourite use of two variants - redundant yo and compound periphrastic relative pronoun el cual, and b) the statistical analysis of sequences of linguistic categories classified and grouped the texts in the two sets under analysis (and also a control text set from another real forensic case) very closely, showing their discriminatory potential, in particular when the sequences were bigrams, something which would lead to the conclusion that these two text sets were produced by the same author.","['Linguistics', 'Pronoun', 'Bigram', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Markedness', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Trigram', 'Archaeology', 'Programming language']",['M.

Transient and persistent hypochondriacal worry in primary care,1996,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291700035650,109,"Synopsis We present a 12-month prospective study of hypochondriacal worry in primary care. Data were obtained from 546 family medicine patients at the time of a physician visit for a new illness and again 1 year later. Patients were divided into four groups based on scores on the Illness Worry Scale: non-hypochondriacal ( N = 460), transient hypochondriacal ( N = 34); emerging hypochondriacal ( N = 21); and persistent hypochondriacal ( N = 31). Persistent patients had significantly more serious medical history but no more serious current illness than those low on illness worry. Patients with persistent illness worry were more likely than others to have a diagnosis of major depression or anxiety disorder, were more likely to believe that their most important significant other would pathologize new symptoms, yet were less likely to have been encouraged to see the doctor by them. Patients who became less worried over the year reported corresponding decreases in distress, attentiveness to bodily sensations, emotional vulnerability and pathological symptom attributions. We conclude that depressive or anxiety disorders, fears of emotional instability, pathological symptom attributional styles and interpersonal vulnerability provide the best prognostic evidence for enduring illness worry.","['Worry', 'Psychology', 'Primary (astronomy)', 'Primary care', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Anxiety', 'Family medicine', 'Physics', 'Astronomy']","['James M.

The Relation of Quantity and Mode of Prosocial Behavior to Moral Cognitions and Social Style,1984,https://doi.org/10.2307/1130017,56,"EISENBERG, NANCY; PASTERNACK, JEANNETTE FLOM; CAMERON, ELLEN; and TRYON, KELLY. The Relation of Quantity and Mode of Prosocial Behavior to Moral Cognitions and Social Style. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1984, 55, 1479-1485. Researchers have seldom differentiated between 2 types of moral cognitions: moral judgments and self-attributions. Thus, the primary purposes of the present study were (a) to examine the relation of preschoolers' self-attributions about their naturally occurring prosocial behaviors to frequency of prosocial responding, and (b) to determine if different types of prosocial behaviors are associated with different configurations of moral judgments, self-attributions, and social behaviors. The prosocial and social behaviors of 44 preschoolers were observed in their classrooms over approximately 9 weeks, and their self-attributions about prosocial acts were elicited. Moreover, for a subsample, moral judgment was assessed. In general, there was some relation of spontaneously emitted prosocial behaviors to both self-attributions and moral judgment, as well as to general sociability. Frequency of requested prosocial behaviors was unrelated to self-attributions or moral judgments, but was associated with low sociability and low assertiveness with peers. Self-attributions were unrelated to moral judgment. The results are discussed in terms of the psychological significance of various types of prosocial actions and the role of both moral cognitions and social style in children's prosocial responding.","['Prosocial behavior', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Moral development', 'Social psychology', 'Social cognition', 'Cognition', 'Developmental psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Social cognitive theory of morality', 'Moral reasoning', 'Moral disengagement', 'Helping behavior', 'Archaeology', 'Neuroscience', 'History']","['Nancy Eisenberg', 'Jeannette Pasternack', 'Ellen Cameron', 'Kelly Tryon']",10,False,Child Development,[]

"""Difficult"" Children as Elicitors and Targets of Adult Communication Patterns: An Attributional-Behavioral Transactional Analysis",1984,https://doi.org/10.2307/1165910,257,"A transactional model of adult-child interaction was proposed and tested. In determining the effects that caregivers and children have on each other, it was maintained that adult attributions act as important moderators in the interaction process. Specifically, it was predicted that adult beliefs about the causes of caregiving outcomes act as selective filters or sensitizers to child behavior--determining the nature and amount of adult reaction to different child behaviors. It was further predicted that adult attributions act in a self-fulfilling fashion, that is, the communication patterns that follow from caregiver beliefs act to elicit child behavior patterns that maintain those beliefs. In a synthetic family strategy, elementary-school-aged boys were paired with unrelated mothers (N = 96) for videotaped interactions. Children were either trained or preselected on two orthogonal dimensions: responsiveness and assertiveness. Mothers were premeasured on their self-perceived power as caregivers (S+) and the social power they attributed to children (C+). Videotapes were analyzed separately for adult facial expression and posture, voice intonation, and verbal communication. Each of these behavioral dimensions was measured on the dimensions of affect, assertion, and ""maternal quality"" (e.g., baby-talk). We expected low self-perceived power to sensitize the adult to variations in child responsiveness and high child-attributed power to sensitize the adult to variations in child assertiveness. Two transactional sequences were obtained (the same patterns were obtained for acted and dispositional enactments of child behavior): 1. Low S+ mothers (in comparison with high S+ mothers) were selectively reactive to child unresponsiveness. These adults reacted to unresponsive children with a communication pattern characterized by a ""maternal"" quality, negative affect, and positive affect that was unassertively inflected. Unresponsive children, in turn, reacted to low S+ mothers wi","['Psychology', 'Assertiveness', 'Developmental psychology', 'Transactional leadership', 'Attribution', 'Permissive', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Nonverbal communication', 'Social relation', 'Transactional analysis', 'Social psychology', 'Communication', 'Genetics', 'Biology']","['Daphne Blunt Bugental', 'William A.

Tracking the Evolution of Literary Style via Dirichlet–Multinomial Change Point Regression,2019,https://doi.org/10.1111/rssa.12492,8,"Summary It is typical in stylometry to assume that authors have a unique writing style which is common to all their published writings and is constant over time. Based on this assumption, statistical techniques can be used to answer literary questions, such as authorship attribution, in a quantitative manner. However, the claim that authors have a constant literary style has not received much investigation or validation. We propose a collection of statistical models based on Dirichlet–multinomial change point regression which can capture the evolution of writing style over time, including both gradual changes in style as the author matures, and abrupt changes which can be caused by extreme events in the author’s life. To illustrate our framework, we study the literary output of the celebrated British author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was tragically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease during the last years of his life. Contrary to the usual assumptions made in stylometry, we find evidence of both gradual changes in style over his lifetime, and an abrupt change which corresponds to his Alzheimer’s diagnosis. We also investigate the published writings of Agatha Christie, who is also rumoured to have suffered from Alheizmer’s disease towards the end of her life, and find evidence of gradual drift, but no corresponding abrupt change. The implications for stylometry and authorship attribution are discussed.","['Stylometry', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Writing style', 'Multinomial distribution', 'Constant (computer programming)', 'Attribution', 'Point (geometry)', 'Literature', 'Variance (accounting)', 'History', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Econometrics', 'Mathematics', 'Social psychology', 'Art', 'Geometry', 'Accounting', 'Business', 'Programming language']",['Gordon J.

Restricted Emotional Processing and Somatic Attribution in Fibromyalgia,2001,https://doi.org/10.2190/k7au-9ux9-w8bw-tetl,81,"Objective: Medically unexplained symptoms or syndromes, such as fibromyalgia (FM), might be partly caused or sustained by a mechanism involving restricted emotional processing (REP) and the subsequent attribution of emotional arousal to somatic or syndrome-consistent causes. In this study, it was hypothesized that FM patients, compared to healthy individuals, would be higher on trait measures of REP (defensiveness and alexithymia), and would show affective-autonomic response dissociation, that is, higher standardized scores of heart rate responses than affective responses, during negative emotional stimulation. Additionally, FM patients were expected to attribute their bodily symptoms more to somatic than to psychological causes. Method: Emotional movie excerpts were shown to 16 female FM patients and 17 healthy women. Affective response and heart rate were monitored continuously, while symptoms and their causal attributions were measured before and after the excerpts. Repressor coping style and alexithymia were measured, along with negative affectivity and habitual attributions of somatic complaints. Results: FM patients nearly all showed the relatively uncommon combination of high defensiveness and high anxiousness. Compared with healthy women FM patients were more alexithymic, showed a higher level of affective-autonomic response dissociation, and lower within-subject emotional variability. The groups showed opposite attributional patterns, with FM patients attributing symptoms less to psychological causes and more to somatic causes. There was no evidence of a shift in these attributions caused by the emotional stimuli. Conclusions: The results provide preliminary support for the hypotheses. Both at trait and at state level, FM showed restricted emotional processing on most of the parameters measured, and a high ratio of somatic to psychological symptom attribution, coupled with high negative affectivity.","['Alexithymia', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Somatization', 'Stimulus (psychology)', 'Trait', 'Heart rate', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Heart rate variability', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Internal medicine', 'Blood pressure', 'Neuroscience', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'Programming language']","['J.

Recent studies show that current source code authorship attribution methods can be compromised by attackers exploiting adversarial examples and coding style manipulation. This calls for robust solutions to the problem of code authorship attribution. In this paper, we initiate the study on making Deep Learning (DL)-based code authorship attribution robust. We propose an innovative framework called Robust coding style Patterns Generation (RoPGen), which essentially learns authors' unique coding style patterns that are hard for attackers to manipulate or imitate. The key idea is to combine data augmentation and gradient augmentation at the adversarial training phase. This effectively increases the diversity of training examples, generates meaningful perturbations to gradients of deep neural networks, and learns diversified representations of coding styles. We evaluate the effectiveness of RoPGen using four datasets of programs written in C, C++, and Java. Experimental results show that RoPGen can significantly improve the robustness of DL-based code authorship attribution, by respectively reducing 22.8% and 41.0% of the success rate of targeted and untargeted attacks on average.",['Computer science'],"['Zhen Li', 'Qian Chen', 'Chen Chen', 'Yayi Zou', 'Shouhuai Xu']",50,False,Proceedings of the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering,"['National Science Foundation', 'National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'Army Research Office']"

The poems of Anna Letitia Barbauld,1994,https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.32-1364,141,"This volume brings together for the first time all the known poems of English writer Anna Letitia Barbauld (1743-1825), a once esteemed but long neglected figure whose career spanned the Age of Sensibility and the Romantic Era. William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft have collected 170 of her poems, including twenty-three previously unpublished and eleven conjectural attributions. This is the first scholarly edition of any writings of Barbauld, a brilliant woman whose interests ranged from literary criticism to history and affairs of state to children's stories. At the end of the eighteenth century, Barbauld may well have been the most eminent living poet, male or female, in Britain.Barbauld belongs almost equally to two generations. Her verse displays an eighteenth-century adherence to balance, common sense, and poetic diction and meter, but it also celebrates the individual, the passionate, and the fanciful in a clearly Romantic manner. In the current reconfiguring of Romanticism, Barbauld provides an important contrast to the major male poets who have, until recently, defined the era--poets who clearly acknowledged her influence on their own work, yet who played a role in Barbauld's lapse into obscurity in the century after her death. Coleridge, before a serious falling out with Barbauld, admired her greatly, and Wordsworth confessed that he wished the final eight lines of her poem Life had been of his own composing. Walter Savage Landor ranked her Summer Evening's Meditation among the finest poems in the English language.Barbauld's poems have retained their capacity to delight readers; they are witty, learned, imaginative, and unpredictable in both choice and treatment of subject. Read as a whole, this collection reveals a striking variety of style and voice and provides the basis for a major--and long overdue--reevaluation of Barbauld's poetry.

They echo Shakespeare, who said, of his `noted weed,' that `every word doth almost [tell] my name, / Showing their birth, and where they did proceed' (sonnet 76.6–8). For these three men, style is more than `an elegant fourme or order in writynge or speakinge,' and invention more than rhetorical inventio, where one finds material in `loci or ``places, seats'' in one's notebooks.' Idiolect reflects `mind' and should be approached through cognition. Descartes notwithstanding, mind is now analysable biologically by scientific methods. Even in the humanities, authorship attribution now uses quantitative profiles of lexical, grammatical, metrical, and syntactic regularities, such as function-word combinations, rare words, and affix usage, as markers of idiolect. Computer text-analysis charts these regularities in concordance, graph, and table and distinguishes the random from the statistically significant, but understanding these textual objects gets us only partway towards idiolect because writing does not exhaust an author's uttering.","['Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Rhetorical question', 'Lexicalization', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Art']",['Ian Lancashire'],65,False,University of Toronto Quarterly,[]

Shoot the messenger? The media’s role in framing populist attributions of blame,2017,https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884917698170,45,"Attributing blame to elites is central to populist communication. Although empirical research has provided initial insights into the effects of populist blame attribution on citizens’ political opinions, little is known about the contextual factors surrounding its presence in the media. Advancing this knowledge, this article draws on an extensive content analysis ( N = 867) covering non-election and election periods to provide insights into how populist blame attributions are embedded in journalistic reporting styles. Using Latent Class Analysis, we first identified three distinct styles of reporting: neutral, conflict, and interpretative coverage. In line with our predictions, we find that populist blame attributions are present most in conjunction with an interpretative journalistic style and least when a neutral journalistic style is used. Populist blame attributions are more likely to be used by journalists of tabloid newspapers than journalists of broadsheet newspapers. These results provide valuable insights for understanding the intersections between journalism and populist communication.","['Blame', 'Attribution', 'Framing (construction)', 'Newspaper', 'Journalism', 'Political science', 'Politics', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Populism', 'Social psychology', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Media studies', 'Law', 'History', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Archaeology']","['Michael Hameleers', 'L.

Right-wing populism and the dynamics of style: a discourse-analytic perspective on mediated political performances,2018,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-018-0132-6,130,"Abstract This article offers new ways of conceptualising style in right wing populist communicative performances, by foregrounding a structured and conceptually informed use of “style” that moves beyond the descriptive sense routinely employed in political communication. Specifically, it explores how a discourse-analytic approach to mediated populist discourse can inform and advance the current understanding of populist ‘style’ by analysing some contextually produced linguistic and discursive choices in populist rhetorical repertoires—i.e., the communicative strategies that are deployed in mediated contexts for right-wing populist political communication. Taking three illustrative examples of right wing populist party performances on TV news and current affairs broadcasts in Greece (GD), France (FN) and the UK (UKIP), the speakers’ use of a range of rhetorical devices is examined using models from socio-linguistics and discourse analysis: aspects of register shifts by GD in blame attribution speeches, interactional ‘bad manners’ in a French political debate, and Nigel Farage speaking ‘candidly’ in three different contexts of news reporting from the UK. In taking such a qualitative approach, it is argued that populist style cannot be defined in terms of one single feature, or set of features, common to all right wing populists and transferrable from one socio-cultural context to another, but more usefully as a set of motivated choices among alternative semiotic resources (linguistic/discursive, interactional and visual), which have social and cultural resonance. This focus on micro-level features of mediated interaction thus offers a more fine-grained understanding of style than is currently the case, as it shows how right-wing populist politicians’ performative styles are situated within specific (here European) socio-cultural and political communicative contexts; in this study, this is to say, the various television broadcasts in which they occur.","['Rhetorical question', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Populism', 'Foregrounding', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Linguistics', 'Semiotics', 'Discourse analysis', 'Media studies', 'Political science', 'Law', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology']","['Mats Ekström', 'Marianna Patrona', 'Joanna Thornborrow']",47,True,Palgrave Communications,[]

Measures of attributional style, attributions for recent events, depressive symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes, hopelessness, and life events were administered to 52 depressed psychiatric inpatients treated with antidepressant medication; the measures were readministered 12 and 24 days later. Results indicated that (a) internal, stable, global attributions for recent positive events mediated a significant association between attributional style for positive life events and decreased hopelessness; (b) decreases in hopelessness mediated a significant association between internal, stable, global attributions for recent positive events and decreases in depressive symptom levels; and (c) depressotypic cognitions were not associated with decreases in either hopelessness or depressive symptom levels.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Depression (economics)', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Dysfunctional family', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Association (psychology)', 'Cognition', 'Psychotherapist', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Jeffrey G.

The “Depressive” Attributional Style Is Not That Depressive for Buddhists,2017,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01003,4,"Numerous studies have shown that depression-prone people are characterized by a chronic style of attributing failures to internal, stable, and global causes, sometimes labeled as the ""depressive attributional style."" Much less is known, however, about how social-cultural factors such as religious beliefs might modulate these processes. In the current study, we hypothesized that Buddhism's view of ultimate internal controllability plays a buffering role against the depressive attributional style and reduces its negative impacts. We administrated measures of attributional styles and psychological adjustments to a sample of Chinese Buddhists as well as a control group recruited in China. Data analyses showed that Buddhists were more likely to attribute bad outcomes to internal, stable, and global causes, but their well-being was less affected by it. Thus, these results indicate that the ""depressive"" attributional style is not that depressive for Buddhists, after all.","['Psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Depression (economics)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Psychiatry', 'Macroeconomics', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'History']","['Michelle T.

"Relationship between Quality of Life, Relationship Beliefs and Attribution Style in Infertile Couples.",2018,https://doi.org/10.22074/ijfs.2018.5221,6,"Many infertile couples experience psychological distress and suffer from impaired quality of life. Generally, when couples are dealing with uncontrolled events such as infertility, it is important to manage it well and to use the suitable coping style; so this can represent an example of attribution style. The purpose of this study is to investigate the quality of life, relationship beliefs and attribution style in infertile couples.This cross-sectional study consisted of 50 infertile couples, who were at least 18 years of age and could read and write in Persian. Participants provided demographic and general characteristics and completed the quality of life (SF-12), relationship belief inventory (RBI) and attribution style (ASQ) forms. Data was analyzed by the paired t test, Pearson correlation tests and multiple linear regression analysis, using SPSS version 22 statistical software.Overall, 50 infertile couples participated in our study. The males had a significantly higher score for quality of life compared to the females (P=0.019). In RBI subscales except ""Disagreement is Destructive"" all others significantly higher in wives than husbands. All subscales of RBI had a negative correlation with the quality of life. The quality of life had a significant correlation with positive internal (r=0.213, P=0.033). The adjusted regression model showed that the quality of life for males was higher than in females (β=-3.098, P=0.024).The current data indicate that in infertile couples, the husbands have a higher quality of life in comparison to their wives. Also, all subscales of relationship beliefs have a negative correlation with the quality of life, but in attribution style, just internal attribution style for positive events is associated with the quality of life. In general, there is a correlation between relationship beliefs and the quality of life in infertile couples.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Quality of life (healthcare)', 'Correlation', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Persian', 'Regression analysis', 'Distress', 'Clinical psychology', 'Positive correlation', 'Life style', 'Medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Applied psychology', 'Statistics', 'Psychotherapist', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Geometry', 'Mathematics', 'Internal medicine']","['Behnaz Navid', 'Maryam Mohammadi', 'Saman Maroufizadeh', 'Payam Amini', 'Zahra Shirin', 'Reza Omani-Saman']",38,False,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),[]

Shallow Text Analysis and Machine Learning for Authorship Attribution,2005,,37,"Current advances in shallow parsing and machine learning allow us to use results from these fields in a methodology for Authorship Attribution. We report on experiments with a corpus that consists of newspaper articles about national current affairs by different journalists from the Belgian newspaper De Standaard. Because the documents are in a similar genre, register, and range of topics, token-based (e.g., sentence length) and lexical features (e.g., vocabulary richness) can be kept roughly constant over the different authors. This allows us to focus on the use of syntax-based features as possible predictors for an author’s style, as well as on those token-based features that are predictive to author style more than to topic or register. These style characteristics are not under the author’s conscious control and therefore good clues for Authorship Attribution. Machine Learning methods (TiMBL and the WEKA software package) are used to select informative combinations of syntactic, token-based and lexical features and to predict authorship of unseen documents. The combination of these features can be considered an implicit profile that characterizes the style of an author.","['Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Authorship attribution', 'Security token', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Newspaper', 'Register (sociolinguistics)', 'Sentence', 'Focus (optics)', 'Parsing', 'Vocabulary', 'Syntax', 'Writing style', 'Linguistics', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Computer security', 'Archaeology', 'Advertising', 'Optics', 'Business']","['Kim Luyckx', 'Walter Daelemans']",15,False,Lot Occasional Series,[]

However, contrary to most attributional models of psychopathology, there is evidence that attributional style is not a stable trait but is affected by recent experiences. Method. Paranoid, depressed, and healthy participants were exposed to a mild stressor in the form of the requirement to complete an anagram task, which included insoluble items. Before and afterwards, they completed measures of attributional style for negative events and a contingency judgment task. Results. Replicating previous findings, paranoid patients initially showed low internality scores for negative events and high judgments of control on the contingency judgment task, whereas the depressed participants showed high internality for negative events and low judgments of control. Following the anagram task, both clinical groups showed increased internality for hypothetical negative events. The paranoid participants also gave increased estimates of control on the contingency judgment task. Conclusions. Attributional style is more labile in paranoid and depressed patients than in healthy individuals.

Analysis of the developed quantitative method for automatic attribution of scientific and technical text content written in Ukrainian,2018,https://doi.org/10.15587/1729-4061.2018.149596,29,"A formal approach was proposed to implement text content attribution. The study was conducted with Ukrainian scientific and technical texts. The results of application of the designed algorithms of automatic attribution of the text content based on the NLP and stylemetry methods were analyzed. Prospects and features of application of stylemetry information technologies for attribution of the text content were considered. Quantitative content analysis of scientific and technical text content takes advantage of content monitoring and text content analysis based on NLP, Web-Mining and stylemetry methods to identify the multitude of authors whose talking style is similar to that of the analyzed text fragment. This narrows the range of search for further use in the stylemetry methods to determine the degree of belonging of the analyzed text to a particular author.Decomposition of the attribution method was carried out based on analysis of such talking coefficients as lexical diversity, degree (measure) of syntactic complexity, talking coherence, indexes of exclusivity and concentration of the text. At the same time, author's style parameters such as the number of words in a certain text, the total number of words of this text, the number of sentences, the number of prepositions, the number of conjunctions, the number of words with occurrence frequency 1, the number of words with occurrence frequency 10 or more were analyzed.

Refining the Explanation of Cotard’s Delusion,2000,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0017.00125,47,"Recent work in cognitive neuropsychiatry explains the Capgras and Cotard delusions as alternative explanations of unusual qualitative states caused by dam‐age to an affective component of the face recognition system. The difference between the delusions results from differences in attributional style. Cotard patients typically exhibit a style of internal attribution associated with depression, while Capgras patients exhibit the external attribution style more typical of paranoia. Thus the Cotard patient attributes her condition to drastic changes in herself and the Capgras patient attributes the same changes to alterations in the environment. I suggest three modifications to this explanation. Firstly, the nature of the affective deficit in Cotard cases may be more global than in Capgras cases, resulting from the diffuse effects of the neurochemical substrate of depression. Secondly, this explanation gives us additional insight into the content of the delusion. It is unsurprising that persons whose global affective responses were suppressed would explain their lack of response by saying that they had no bodily existence. Finally I suggest that in Cotard cases the delusion is produced by a reasoning deficit, rather than attributional style.","['Delusion', 'Epistemology', 'Psychology', 'Refining (metallurgy)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Cognitive science', 'Philosophy', 'Psychiatry', 'Chemistry', 'Physical chemistry']",['Philip Gerrans'],21,False,Mind & Language,[]

Subjects were assessed across social cognitive dimensions after imagining themselves involved in interactions portrayed in six videotaped vignettes. Subjects responded to vignette-based questions representing sociomoral judgments and multiple components of social information processing. The findings indicated that: (1) sociomoral judgments about possible aggressive responses across varied social contexts consistently predicted externalizing problems; and (2) sociomoral judgments about aggression mediated the relation between hostile attributional style and externalizing behavior. The findings suggest that sociomoral judgments about aggression play a crucial role in the tendency to react aggressively. (Contains 77 references.)

Attributions and expectations: A confluence of vulnerabilities in mild depression in a college student population.,1987,https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.53.2.349,42,"The reformulated model of learned helplessness assumes that attributional style has its impact on depression in part through the intermediary effect of pessimistic or negative expectations about the occurrence of future outcomes. A possible logical next step in testing the model is to measure jointly attributions and expectations and to examine their combined (interactive) contributions. We used a short-term longitudinal design to examine whether attributional style works in combination with other factors, such as expectations, to predispose individuals to depression. Consistent with the initial theoretical analysis, the interaction of attributional style and expectations predicted depression on the Beck Depression Inventory 6 weeks later. We also found that attributional style predicted depression 6 weeks later in interaction with initial level of depression. These findings support our confluence hypothesis, which assumes that vulnerability factors can combine interactively and qualify the effects of attributional style. These interaction-effect findings have implications for currently popular cognitive theories of depression and for previous research on vulnerability to depression that has examined only the effects of single cognitive variables (such as attributional style) considered alone. Further study is also necessary to determine the nature of the overlap of the effects of expectation and initial level of depression.","['Learned helplessness', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Pessimism', 'Depression (economics)', 'Cognitive vulnerability', 'Beck Depression Inventory', 'Vulnerability (computing)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Population', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive style', 'Social psychology', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Psychiatry', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Philosophy', 'Computer security', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Epistemology', 'Demography', 'Sociology', 'Computer science', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['John H.

Causal attributions during therapy II: Reconstituted families and parental blaming,2003,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-6427.00242,38,"A powerful route to understanding communication within the family is provided by identifying and coding the causal attributions they make during family therapy sessions. The analysis of attributions of responsibility reported in the first of these linked papers (Stratton, 2003) is here extended to explore the accounts given by biological, step‐ and adoptive parents about their children. Some 1799 causal attributions offered spontaneously by the family members during therapy were analysed according to the Leeds Attributional Coding System (Stratton et al ., 1988). Attributional styles that previously have been found to relate to abuse were more common when stepfathers talked about their children, although none of the parents were believed to be abusing their children. The adoptive parents' attributions were more explicit about problems with the children but were more likely to be functional. Stepfathers made substantially more attributions in the form of blaming a child, with the dimensions identifying characterological blaming being especially significant. Alternative styles of attributing which would offer a way of avoiding characterological blaming are presented. Possible causes and consequences of the consistencies in problematic attributing, and the implications for therapy, are discussed.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Coding (social sciences)', 'Family therapy', 'Developmental psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Sociology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Social science']",['Peter Stratton'],37,True,Journal of Family Therapy,[]

The results partially support the hypothesis that cognitive factors are related to definition and severity ratings of self-report measures of particular types of life events. These relationships held primarily for achievement, as compared with interpersonal, events.

The buffering role of women's attributional explanations for the event, the significance of the loss of the baby, coping strategies, and women's knowledge of miscarriage were also assessed. Correlational analyses revealed that women's attributions were tied to their reactions, in that the more women blamed their own character or doctor, the more severely they reacted. Coping strategies accounted for a large portion of the variance (64%), whereby women who used cognitive restructuring as a strategy suffered less adverse reactions than did those who used social withdrawal or wishrul thinking. Women's knowledge before miscarriage, rather than after, accounted for 6% of the variance in their reactions. Examining the interrelations of these variables revealed that the amount of women's knowledge before miscarriage was related to less wishful thinking, and their knowledge after the event was related to less problem avoidance. Women's attributions were also related to their coping strategies: Blaming one's character, behavior, or doctor were positively related to self‐criticism and social withdrawal, and negatively related to support from doctors and significant others.

Evaluating Optimism: Developing Children’s Version of Optimistic Attributional Style Questionnaire,2017,https://doi.org/10.17759/chp.2017130206,8,"People differ significantly in how they usually explain to themselves the reasons of events, both positive and negative, that happen in their lives. Psychological research shows that children who tend to think optimistically have certain advantages as compared to their pessimistically thinking peers: they are less likely to suffer from depression, establish more positive relationships with peers, and demonstrate higher academic achievements. This paper describes the process of creating the children’s version of the Optimistic Attributional Style Questionnaire (OASQ-C). This technique is based on the theory of learned hopelessness and optimism developed by M. Seligman, L. Abramson and J. Teas dale and is an efficient (compact) tool for measuring optimism as an explanatory style in children and adolescents (9-14 years). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that this technique is a two-factor structure with acceptable reliability. Validity is supported by the presence of expected correlations between explanatory style and rates of psychological well-being, dispositional optimism, positive attitude to life and its aspects, depression, and academic performance. The outcomes of this technique are not affected by social desirability. The developed questionnaire may be recommended to researchers and school counsellors for evaluating optimism (optimistic thinking) as one of the major factors in psychological well-being of children; it may also be used in assessing the effectiveness of cognitive oriented training for adolescents.","['Optimism', 'Psychology', 'Confirmatory factor analysis', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Cognitive style', 'Social psychology', 'Reliability (semiconductor)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Psychiatry', 'Power (physics)', 'Statistics', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'History']","['Т.О.

For total Metacognitions Questionnaire-30, the high all and high paranoid clusters did not differ, and both clusters scored higher than the high paranormal group, who all scored higher than the low all cluster. For attributional styles (Attributional Styles Questionnaire), lower scores on internal positive attribution were found for the high all and high paranoid clusters compared to the low all and high paranormal clusters. The high paranormal cluster had higher scores than the high paranoid cluster on self-serving bias. Differences in attributional style appeared to be driven by mental health diagnosis.

An experimental study was conducted where critic's style, critic's predisposition toward the film director, degree of agreement between the critic's judgment and that of other critics, reputation of the critic, reputation of the film director, and critic's judgment direction were manipulated in a mixed within-subjects factorial design. A summary movie review was constructed for each condition of the factorial design. Viewer's movie evaluations were assessed with the use of four evaluative bipolar scales. Three of the five research hypotheses were fully supported. Consistent with the predictions of attribution theory, it was found that consumers' evaluations of a new movie are more likely to follow the judgment of a film critic when this judgment does not conform to the critic's style (H1), when the judgment is inconsistent with the critic's predisposition toward the film director (H2) and when other critics' judgments show favorable consensus (H3). The other two research hypotheses were partially supported. The impact of the film director's reputation on consumer evaluations (H5) was significant only when the movie reviews were positive, whereas the impact of the critic's reputation (H4) was significant only in the case of negative reviews.

Attribution of Somatic Symptoms in Hypochondriasis,2013,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.1871,49,"The misinterpretation of bodily symptoms as an indicator of a serious illness is a key feature of the criteria and the cognitive–behavioural models of hypochondriasis. Previous research suggests that individuals suffering from health anxiety endorse attributions of physical disease, whereas persons with elevated general anxiety have the tendency to attribute psychological causes to their symptoms. However, whether a somatic attribution style is specific to patients with hypochondriasis, as opposed to those with anxiety disorders, has not yet been investigated and is therefore part of the present study. Fifty patients with hypochondriasis, 50 patients with a primary anxiety disorder and 50 healthy participants were presented with nine common bodily sensations and had to spontaneously attribute possible causes to the symptoms. Patients with hypochondriasis differed from patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls in giving significantly fewer normalizing explanations, but attributing more often in terms of moderate or serious diseases. Patients with anxiety disorders also made significantly fewer normalizing attributions and more somatic attributions to a severe illness than healthy controls. There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of psychological attributions and somatic attributions concerning mild diseases. The present study demonstrates that hypochondriasis is associated with a disorder‐specific attribution style connecting somatic symptoms primarily with moderate and serious diseases. By contrast, normalizing attributions are largely omitted from consideration by patients with hypochondriasis. The findings conform with the cognitive conception of hypochondriasis and support the strategy of modifying symptom attributions, as practiced in cognitive–behavioural therapy.

Stylometric analysis of Early Modern period English plays,2017,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqx059,27,"Function word adjacency networks (WANs) are used to study the authorship of plays from the Early Modern English period. In these networks, nodes are function words and directed edges between two nodes represent the relative frequency of directed co-appearance of the two words. For every analyzed play, a WAN is constructed and these are aggregated to generate author profile networks. We first study the similarity of writing styles between Early English playwrights by comparing the profile WANs. The accuracy of using WANs for authorship attribution is then demonstrated by attributing known plays among six popular playwrights.

"Religious Commitment, Attributional Style, and Gender as Predictors of Undergraduate Volunteer Behavior and Attitudes",1999,https://doi.org/10.1177/009164719902700306,6,"One hundred twenty-two undergraduates attending a Jesuit university were surveyed concerning their religious commitment, belief in God control, attributional styles, and attitudes and behavior related to community service. Discriminant and multiple regression analyses indicated that scores on the God as Causal Agent scale (Ritzema &amp; Young, 1983) and on the Powerful Others scale (Levenson, 1974) were significantly correlated with self-reported volunteer activity, with proservice attitudes, and with being identified as a community service volunteer by the university. Exploring gender differences revealed that religious commitment scores were correlated with Internality scores for males but not for females. In addition, the correlations between both God as Causal Agent and Internality (Levenson, 1974) scores and community service variables were significantly higher for male students than for female students. Findings suggest that research on altruism will benefit both by further exploring religious attribution and by examining possible moderator effects when investigating such relationships.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Moderation', 'Social psychology', 'Altruism (biology)', 'Scale (ratio)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Physics', 'Archaeology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'History']",['Frank M.

Three months after the earthquakes, both groups were approached with questions from a survey consisting of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ), the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC), the Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ), the World Assumption Scale (WAS), and the Crisis Support Scale (CSS). The results revealed that 24% in the exposed group had Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and none in the control group had PTSD. Earthquake-related anxiety, inability to express one's thoughts and feelings, and emotional coping predicted 81% of the HTQ variance for both groups. Previous life events, low self-worth, and luck attributions, together with numbing and the feeling of being let down, predicted 56% of the symptom variance for both groups.

Social Identity Reduces Depression by Fostering Positive Attributions,2014,https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550614543309,107,"Social identities are generally associated with better health and in particular lower levels of depression. However, there has been limited investigation of why social identities protect against depression. The current research suggests that social identities reduce depression in part because they attenuate the depressive attribution style (internal, stable, and global; e.g., “I failed because I’m stupid”). These relationships are first investigated in a survey (Study 1, N = 139) and then followed up in an experiment that manipulates social identity salience (Study 2, N = 88). In both cases, people with stronger social identities were less likely to attribute negative events to internal, stable, or global causes and subsequently reported lower levels of depression. These studies thus indicate that social identities can protect and enhance mental health by facilitating positive interpretations of stress and failure.

The origins of sex differences in depressive disorder: bridging the gap,1996,https://doi.org/10.3109/09540269609051547,243,"The high prevalence of depressive disorder in women is well established. However, it has not been convincingly explained. This reflects a more general failure of research to provide a comprehensive aetiological account of depression. The examination of the sex difference can be used as a probe to evaluate how far we have gone in substantiating integrated models of depressive disorder. In this paper, I review several lines of investigation in order to assess the relative importance of social, psychological and biological influences on the sex difference in depression. These include the epidemiology of macrosocial variables and age effects, and the exploration of relevant psychological attributes, including temperament, personality, and attributional and coping styles. We must also consider the experience of psychosocial adversity, and in particular the possibility of an increased susceptibility of women to some forms of stress. Both the tendency to affiliation and the requirement for social support seem stronger in women. There is appreciable direct and indirect evidence that the particular strains of the roles available to women may increase their risk of depression. Biological explanations tend to be couched in hormonal terms. However, the most convincing hormonal correlates of depressive disorder relate not to sex hormones but to corticosteroids and their control mechanisms. These do not appear to differ by sex. However, the greatest problem for biological explanations of the sex difference lies in the failure of genetic models to account for it. It is hard to conceive of a biological substrate unaffected by genetic factors. Thus, while there seems no doubt that biological factors are involved in the emergence of depressive disorder, they do not appear to be responsible for the sex difference. All told, the evidence for environmental effects is much better for social than for physical factors, and a plausible case can be made for a developmental perspective involv","['Bridging (networking)', 'Psychology', 'Major depressive disorder', 'Clinical psychology', 'Computer science', 'Computer security', 'Mood']",['Paul Bebbington'],372,False,International Review of Psychiatry,[]

Attachment style in patients with unexplained physical complaints,2000,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291799002317,104,"Background. Patients who present with physical symptoms that lack an organic explanation are common, difficult to help and poorly understood. Their medical help-seeking is a form of care-eliciting behaviour and, as such, may be understandable in terms of attachment style. Adult attachment style influences functioning in relationships, and may affect help-seeking behaviour from professional carers such as the family doctor.Method. A consecutive sample of 2042 primary-care attenders completed questionnaires on: the reason for consultation, attribution of symptoms, psychiatric distress (GHQ), somatic distress (BSI), and self-reported adult attachment style (ASQ). Their doctors rated presentations into explained physical, unexplained physical, or psychological.Results. There is a powerful relationship between type of presentation and adult attachment style. Both abnormal attachment and level of psychiatric distress increased significantly from the explained physical group, through the unexplained physical group to the group who presented psychologically. Logistic regression models determined three explanatory variables that made significant independent contributions to presentation type: psychiatric distress, attachment style and symptom attribution.Conclusion. Presentation to the doctor with unexplained physical symptoms is associated with both higher levels of psychiatric symptoms and abnormal attachment style when compared to presentations with organic physical symptoms. Patients who present overt psychological symptoms suffer more psychiatric distress and have more abnormal attachment than those presenting physical symptoms (either organically explained or unexplained). Models to explain these findings are discussed.","['Attribution', 'Attachment theory', 'Distress', 'Psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Presentation (obstetrics)', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Physical illness', 'Emotional distress', 'Medicine', 'Mental health', 'Anxiety', 'Social psychology', 'Communication', 'Radiology']","['Rumina Taylor', 'A.

Capsule Network Over Pre-Trained Language Model and User Writing Styles for Authorship Attribution on Short Texts,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3562007.3562027,1,"Authorship Attribution (AA) is a sub-field of Authorship Analysis and text classification, attributing a text to the correct author among a closed set of potential authors. Since short texts usually contain less information about the author, authorship attribution on short texts is often more challenging than authorship attribution on long texts. Recently, the widespread use of pre-trained language models has greatly improved the accuracy of text classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a model which uses the pre-trained language model BERTweet with capsule networks, to solve the authorship attribution on tweets. BERTweet is the first large-scale domain-specific pre-trained language model for English tweets, which can generate high-quality sentence representations of tweets. We combine BERTweet with capsule networks which are particularly powerful at capturing deep features of sentence representations. Thus, both BERTweet and capsule help us achieve remarkable improvements on AA tasks. We also incorporate user writing styles into our model. We design new architectures of capsule networks which combine multiple capsule layers, for generating representations from tweets and user writing styles, improving prediction accuracy and robustness. Our experimental results show that our BERTweet_Capsule_UWS combination shows the state-of-the-art result on the known tweet AA dataset.","['Computer science', 'Sentence', 'Authorship attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Attribution', 'Language model', 'Writing style', 'Robustness (evolution)', 'Field (mathematics)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Information retrieval', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Biochemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Gene', 'Programming language']","['Zeping Huang', 'Mizuho Iwaihara']",8,False,,[]

The Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ) and the Pragmatic Inferential Test (PIT) were used to assess explicit and implicit attributional style, respectively.All participants, with the exception of the depressed patients group, showed an externalizing bias (EB) for negative events. Although both acute and remitted deluded patients showed a similar overall pattern of explicit attributions, the personalizing bias (PB) was significantly greater in the acute group. The magnitude of this bias, which was also found in the depressed patients, was significantly related to the patient's degree of severity, as assessed by the total BPRS score (r=.45, p<.001). The results on the implicit attributions were more equivocal, perhaps due the low reliability of the PIT.Attributional biases seem to be a stable characteristic of delusions.

Mind Perception in HRI: Exploring Users’ Attribution of Mental and Emotional States to Robots with Different Behavioural Styles,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-023-00989-z,10,"Abstract Theory of Mind is crucial to understand and predict others’ behaviour, underpinning the ability to engage in complex social interactions. Many studies have evaluated a robot’s ability to attribute thoughts, beliefs, and emotions to humans during social interactions, but few studies have investigated human attribution to robots with such capabilities. This study contributes to this direction by evaluating how the cognitive and emotional capabilities attributed to the robot by humans may be influenced by some behavioural characteristics of robots during the interaction. For this reason, we used the Dimensions of Mind Perception questionnaire to measure participants’ perceptions of different robot behaviour styles, namely Friendly, Neutral, and Authoritarian, which we designed and validated in our previous works.

Pretreatment patient factors predicting attrition from a multicenter randomized controlled treatment study for panic disorder,1998,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0010-440x(98)90043-8,72,"This study examined pretreatment factors associated with attrition from a clinical trial for panic disorder. The study group consisted of 162 patients who began 11-visit treatments. Six domains (demography, panic disorder severity, psychiatric comorbidity, illness/treatment attributions, coping styles, and personality styles) with 52 variables were used to predict attrition. One hundred twenty-two patients completed and 40 dropped out from treatment. Final multivariate regression analyses showed that the following two variables were independently associated with attrition: lower household income and negative treatment attitudes; attributing the panic disorder to life stressors and greater age were independently associated with attrition at the trend level. Preliminary analyses suggested, in addition, associations between attrition and lower education, shorter length of prior treatment, higher anxiety sensitivity, lower agoraphobic avoidance, and a coping style of seeking social support that were not confirmed by best predictor analysis. Psychiatric comorbidity and personality styles were unrelated to attrition. The implications of these findings for future research and clinical practice are discussed.","['Attrition', 'Panic disorder', 'Agoraphobia', 'Psychology', 'Anxiety sensitivity', 'Comorbidity', 'Panic', 'Psychiatry', 'Personality', 'Clinical psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety disorder', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Confounding', 'Medicine', 'Internal medicine', 'Social psychology', 'Dentistry']","['Carlos M.

Attributional biases in paranoid schizophrenia: Further evidence for a decreased sense of self‐causation in paranoia,2010,https://doi.org/10.1080/17522431003717675,52,"Attributional biases are assumed to be part of the pathogenesis of persecutory delusions. The aim of the present study was to explore whether such biases are confined to current paranoid delusions or related to other positive symptoms as well. Another goal was to investigate whether current paranoid schizophrenia patients only show an exaggerated personalizing bias for negative events (i.e. personalizing blame) or also tend to externalize responsibility for positive events (i.e. decreased sense of self‐causation). The Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ) was administered to 29 schizophrenia patients (10 with current paranoia), 26 psychiatric patients (OCD) and 33 healthy controls. Acutely paranoid patients made fewer internal attributions for positive and negative events, thus replicating a previously reported decreased sense of self‐causation. This kind of attributional style was related to acute positive symptomatology, but not to persecutory beliefs in particular. No evidence was found for a relationship between personalizing blame and the severity of current persecutory beliefs. An analysis of the narrative causal statements of the IPSAQ revealed that paranoid patients more often made external‐situational attributions particularly for positive events. Both psychiatric groups gave significantly more mono‐causal explanations for events than healthy controls.","['Paranoia', 'Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Causation', 'Paranoid schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Situational ethics', 'Blame', 'Delusion', 'Paranoid Disorders', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychosis', 'Social psychology', 'Political science', 'Law']","['Sarah Randjbar', 'Ruth Veckenstedt', 'Francesca Vitzthum', 'Birgit Hottenrott', 'Steffen Moritz']",41,False,Psychosis,[]
Arabic Authorship Attribution,2018,https://doi.org/10.1145/3236391,22,"Law enforcement faces problems in tracing the true identity of offenders in cybercrime investigations. Most offenders mask their true identity, impersonate people of high authority, or use identity deception and obfuscation tactics to avoid detection and traceability. To address the problem of anonymity, authorship analysis is used to identify individuals by their writing styles without knowing their actual identities. Most authorship studies are dedicated to English due to its widespread use over the Internet, but recent cyber-attacks such as the distribution of Stuxnet indicate that Internet crimes are not limited to a certain community, language, culture, ideology, or ethnicity. To effectively investigate cybercrime and to address the problem of anonymity in online communication, there is a pressing need to study authorship analysis of languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, and so on. Arabic, the focus of this study, is the fourth most widely used language on the Internet. This study investigates authorship of Arabic discourse/text, especially tiny text, Twitter posts. We benchmark the performance of a profile-based approach that uses n -grams as features and compare it with state-of-the-art instance-based classification techniques. Then we adapt an event-visualization tool that is developed for English to accommodate both Arabic and English languages and visualize the result of the attribution evidence. In addition, we investigate the relative effect of the training set, the length of tweets, and the number of authors on authorship classification accuracy. Finally, we show that diacritics have an insignificant effect on the attribution process and part-of-speech tags are less effective than character-level and word-level n -grams.","['Cybercrime', 'Computer science', 'Anonymity', 'Authorship attribution', 'The Internet', 'Identity (music)', 'Cyberspace', 'Online identity', 'Stylometry', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer security', 'World Wide Web', 'Physics', 'Acoustics']","['Malik H.

The purpose of the current longitudinal study was to examine the dynamic relations between parents' depressive symptoms and children's cognitions, specifically their attributions for the causes of life events. Participants were 227 parent–child dyads with one parent (Mage = 42.19, SD = 6.82; 76% female) and one child (Mage = 12.53, SD = 2.33; 53% female) per family. Parents either were diagnosed with a current major depressive disorder (n= 129; 72.9% female) or were lifetime-free of mood disorders (n= 98; 79.6% female). The Beck Depression Inventory-II was used to obtain a dimensional measure of parents' depressive symptoms, and the Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire–Revised was used to assess children's attributions of negative and positive events. Evaluations were conducted 5 times across 22 months. We used latent difference score (LDS) modeling to examine the relations between changes in parents' depressive symptoms and changes in children's attributional style over time. The final model provided a close fit to the data: χ2(30) = 35.22, p = .24; comparative fit index = .995, root mean square error of approximation = .028, 90% confidence interval (CI) [.000, .060], standardized root mean square residual = .024. Parents' levels of depressive symptoms significantly predicted the worsening of children's attributions (i.e., becoming more pessimistic) over the 22 months, whereas children's attributions did not significantly predict changes in parents' depressive symptoms at the next time point.

Positive emotionality at age 3 predicts cognitive styles in 7-year-old children,2006,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579406060226,110,"This study examined associations between temperament at age 3 and depressotypic cognitive styles at age 7 in a community sample of children. Sixty-four preschool aged children were assessed for positive emotionality (PE) and negative emotionality (NE) using a standardized battery of laboratory tasks and naturalistic home observations. At follow-up 4 years later, the children completed laboratory tasks designed to tap helplessness in social and problem-solving situations, positive and negative information-processing biases, and self-reports of attributional style. Lower PE at age 3 predicted greater helplessness in the interpersonal task and decreased positive schematic processing. There was little evidence for a relationship between NE and depressotypic cognitive styles.

In the context of “losing”, but not “winning”, deals, children who had been exposed to maternal depression, either in the previous 12 months or at any other time during their lifetime, were more likely than nonexposed children to express depressive cognitions (hopelessness, pessimism, and low self‐worth). The association between depressive cognitions and recent exposure to maternal depression was in part accounted for by current maternal hostility to the child. The results of this study stand in contrast to those of studies which have used questionnaire methods to assess vulnerability to depressive cognitions in this age group.

"The Social Explanatory Styles Questionnaire: Assessing Moderators of Basic Social-Cognitive Phenomena Including Spontaneous Trait Inference, the Fundamental Attribution Error, and Moral Blame",2014,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100886,13,"Why is he poor? Why is she failing academically? Why is he so generous? Why is she so conscientious? Answers to such everyday questions—social explanations—have powerful effects on relationships at the interpersonal and societal levels. How do people select an explanation in particular cases? We suggest that, often, explanations are selected based on the individual's pre-existing general theories of social causality. More specifically, we suggest that over time individuals develop general beliefs regarding the causes of social events. We refer to these beliefs as social explanatory styles. Our goal in the present article is to offer and validate a measure of individual differences in social explanatory styles. Accordingly, we offer the Social Explanatory Styles Questionnaire (SESQ), which measures three independent dimensions of social explanatory style: Dispositionism, historicism, and controllability. Studies 1–3 examine basic psychometric properties of the SESQ and provide positive evidence regarding internal consistency, factor structure, and both convergent and divergent validity. Studies 4–6 examine predictive validity for each subscale: Does each explanatory dimension moderate an important phenomenon of social cognition? Results suggest that they do.

A longitudinal study of the hopelessness theory of depression: Testing the diathesis‐stress model within a differential reactivity and exposure framework,2002,https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.10043,34,"Abstract A ten‐week prospective longitudinal study was conducted to test the diathesis‐stress component of the hopelessness theory and to test whether negative attributional style leads to an increased exposure to stressors. Participants completed initial measures of attributional style and depressive symptoms followed by weekly assessments of depressive symptoms and daily hassles. Consistent with the diathesis‐stress hypothesis, Hierarchical Linear Modeling revealed that attributional style moderated the impact of daily hassles on depressive symptoms. Negative attributional style predicted greater depressive symptom reactivity in response to stress. The results also indicated that attributional style was not predictive of the number of subsequent daily hassles. Thus, the data were supportive of a differential reactivity to stress model, but not supportive of a differential exposure to stress model. Implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in the hopelessness theory are discussed. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

LEARNED HELPLESSNESS AND ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLES,1992,https://doi.org/10.5926/jjep1953.40.3_287,3,"The reformulated learned helplessness theory predicts that individuals who make internal, stable, global attributions for negative outcomes (i.e. depressive attributors) are more likely to become depressed when confronted with uncontrollable failures. To test this hypothesis, depressive attributors and nondepressive attributors (individuals making external, unstable, specific attributions) were exposed to either a solvable or an unsolvable cognitive task. They were later tested on a solvable test task. The results partially supported the reformulated learned helplessness theory, i.e. the theory is to predict an unsolvable task significantly impaired the performance of both depressive and nondepressive attributors. On the other hand, contrary to the theory's prediction, depressive attributors showed significantly less impairment in their performance than nondepressive subjects regardless of the pre-treatment. Additionally, path analysis revealed that the stability dimension of attributional style was found to be mildly related to test performance.","['Learned helplessness', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Task (project management)', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Test (biology)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Cognition', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Paleontology', 'Management', 'Economics', 'Biology']","['Osamu Oashi', 'Hajime Aoyagi', 'Kazuaki Hosoda']",0,True,The Japanese Journal of Educational Psychology,[]
The Relationship Between Quality of Life and Self-esteem and Attribution Styles in Primary School Students,2016,https://doi.org/10.17795/ijpbs-5850,5,"Background: Quality of life, self-esteem and attribution styles have important effects on people's individual and social functions. Through determining the interactional relations of these factors, parents and schools can plan to change each one of them and improve their children's functions. Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate the interactional relations among students' quality of life, self-esteem and attribution styles. Methods: The research sample included 365 primary school students (154 boys and 211 girls), who were selected through random cluster sampling. They filled in the questionnaire after each item was read by their teacher. Research tools included three questionnaires including Sieberer's quality of life, Seligman's attribution styles and Rosenberg's self-esteem questionnaires. Statistical analyses were conducted by Pearson correlation and analysis of regression. Results: The results indicated that there was a significant positive relationship among dimensions of quality of life (except for physical well-being and peers relation and support) and self-esteem. Furthermore, there was a significant negative relationship between self-esteem and negative mood (from components of quality of life) and all components of quality of life were significant predictors of self-esteem. On the other hand, self-esteem was the greatest predictor of negative mood (0.13) and efficiency in the school environment (0.02) (from components of quality of life) (P = 0.01). The results also showed that there were significant positive correlations among optimistic attribution style, self-perception and peers relation and support (from components of quality of life). Conclusions: Since variables of negative mood and efficiency at the school environment were effective factors on self-esteem and, optimistic attribution style was affected by peers relation and support, educational planning for each indicator can improve the quality of life of primary school students.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Self-esteem', 'Quality of life (healthcare)', 'Mood', 'Cluster sampling', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Medicine', 'Population', 'Environmental health', 'Psychotherapist']","['Yahya Kazemi', 'Zahra Nikmanesh', 'Masome Khosravi']",14,True,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,[]

Attributional, cognitive, and affective reactions to two successive binges, as well as the latencies between each binge and a subsequent binge, were evaluated through a series of structured phone interviews with 50 nonpurging normal-weight female bingers. Reported mood after binging was unrelated to binge latency. However, when Ss made more intense internal, global, and uncontrollable causal attributions for a binge, a subsequent binge followed significantly sooner. Within-subject variations in AVEs across binges prospectively predicted within-subject variations in the speed with which another binge followed. Analyses suggested that cognitive states (e.g., AVE and guilt) evoked by particular events were better predictors of how quickly binging repeats than were stable differences in attributional style.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Abstinence', 'Binge eating', 'Cognition', 'Binge drinking', 'Mood', 'Developmental psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Eating disorders', 'Poison control', 'Injury prevention', 'Medicine', 'Environmental health']","['Carlos M.

Why don't older adults with subjective memory complaints seek help?,2011,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.2731,93,"Background Subjective memory complaints (SMCs) are common among older adults, often causing significant distress and showing strong relationships to future cognitive decline. However, low rates of help‐seeking for memory complaints are well documented. Little is known about the reasons behind the decision to seek or not to seek help with memory problems. The common‐sense model of illness perception proposes that the beliefs people hold about their health underlie help‐seeking behaviour. The present study investigated factors underlying the decision to seek help in people with SMCs within the framework of the common‐sense model of illness perception. Methods Cognition, illness perceptions, coping styles, depression and anxiety were assessed in 98 adults with SMCs, aged 50 years and above, including 60 attending a memory clinic and 38 non‐help‐seekers. Results Objective cognitive performance did not differ between participants who had sought help and those who had not. Logistic regression revealed that illness perceptions including social comparison and causal attributions predict help‐seeking behaviour. More general coping style did not predict help‐seeking. Furthermore, participants who had sought help were more likely to have had a close relative with dementia. Conclusions The results suggest that beliefs about memory, rather than objective cognitive impairment, are associated with the decision to seek help for SMCs. The findings suggest that providing education regarding memory problems, in particular challenging causal attributions, may help to encourage help‐seeking in people with SMCs and improve care in the early stages of dementia.

The Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety-Revised and the Sydney Attribution Scale were administered to 1287 Spanish students aged 8 to 11 (M = 9.68, SD = 1.20); 49.4% were girls. Four child anxiety profiles were obtained by the latent class analysis technique: Low Anxiety, Moderate Anxiety, High Anxiety, and Low Anxiety School-type. The four anxious groups significantly differed in all attributions of failure and in attributions of success to ability and effort, with effect sizes ranging from small to large (d = 0.24 to 0.99). The group with the highest anxiety levels attributed its failures more to the lack of ability and effort, and less to external causes. This group attributed its successes less to ability and effort. However, the Low Anxiety School-type group attributed its failures more to external causes and its successes more to ability and effort. The practical implications of these findings suggest that applying cognitive-behavioral programs for anxiety with a component of attribution retraining could be useful to improve both anxiety levels and the maladaptive attributional pattern of each child anxiety profile.","['Anxiety', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Psychiatry']","['Aitana Fernández‐Sogorb', 'María Vicent', 'Carolina Gonzálvez', 'Ricardo Sanmartín', 'Antonio Miguel Pérez Sánchez', 'José Manuel García-Fernández']",46,True,Sustainability,['Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación']

Detecting Stylistic Deception,2012,,22,"Whistleblowers and activists need the ability to communicate without disclosing their identity, as of course do kidnappers and terrorists. Recent advances in the technology of stylometry (the study of authorial style) or authorship attribution have made it possible to identify the author with high reliability in a non-confrontational setting. In a confrontational setting, where the author is deliberately masking their identity (i.e. attempting to deceive), the results are much less promising.

Prevalence of depressive tendencies among college students and the influence of attributional styles on depressive tendencies in the post-pandemic era,2024,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1326582,8,"Introduction Depression symptoms are prevalent globally, including China, with a notable impact on college students. This study aims to not only estimate the prevalence of depressive tendencies and attributional styles among college students in the post-pandemic era but also explore the relationship between the two factors. The findings of this study can provide new insights into early intervention and support services for individuals exhibiting tendencies toward depression. Methods The survey was administered to college students from various academic backgrounds at a specific university in southern Jiangxi Province by employing two scales to investigate depressive tendencies and attributional styles. Depressive tendency was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), while the attributional styles were assessed using the Multidimensional-Multiattributional Causality Scale (MMCS). Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to identify the related factors of depressive tendency. Results A relatively high (48.9%) prevalence of depression among college students was found in this study. College students with higher grades (OR = 1.574, 95%CI: 1.369–1.810), profession of medicine and allied health sciences (OR = 1.779, 95%CI: 1.203–2.629), experiencing higher study stress (OR = 2.006, 95%CI: 1.601–2.514), and having poor physical condition (OR = 1.527, 95%CI: 1.247–1.869) were identified as risk factors for depressive tendency. The correlation between higher grades and increased learning pressure, coupled with poorer physical condition, heightens the vulnerability of college students to depression.

Optimistic Attributional Style as a Predictor of Well-Being: Exploring the Mediating Roles of Gratitude and Savoring the Moment,2021,https://doi.org/10.11621/pir.2021.0304,6,"Background. The construct of attributional style refers to the specific ways people explain events, both positive and negative. An optimistic attributional style (OAS) for negative events has been shown to be reliably associated with low rates of depression (Peterson et al., 1985; Sweeney et al., 1986; Hu et al., 2015). On the contrary, an optimistic attributional style for positive events is a separate phenomenon associated mainly with well-being, but these relationships remain underexplored. Objective. This study aimed to explore the predictive power of OAS-Positive, its relationships with subjective well-being, and possible personality mediators related to positive functioning. We hypothesized that the abilities to feel grateful and savor positive life events mediate the relationship between optimistic thinking about positive outcomes and subjective well-being. Design. A сross-sectional design was implemented. The participants were 271 adults from Moscow and Moscow Region (M age=32.42, SD=12.9). Results. The results of regression analysis showed that both life satisfaction and subjective happiness depended on gratitude, self-esteem, and dispositional optimism, but only happiness was predicted by savoring the moment. The results of structural equation modeling were consistent with the hypothesis since the structural model revealed that the effects of OAS-Positive on subjective well-being were fully mediated by gratitude and savoring the moment, as well as self-esteem and dispositional optimism. The mediated effects of OAS-Negative through self-esteem and gratitude were inconsistent, and its total indirect effect on subjective well-being was not significant. Conclusion. This research provides preliminary evidence that optimistic thinking about positive life events promotes subjective well-being through a system of positive psychological traits and attitudes which include gratitude and savoring the moment.","['Gratitude', 'Psychology', 'Optimism', 'Happiness', 'Life satisfaction', 'Structural equation modeling', 'Subjective well-being', 'Well-being', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Personality', 'Social psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Positive psychology', 'Personality psychology', 'Self-esteem', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Archaeology', 'History']","['Victoria A.

The first study suggested that 45% of the variance in a measure of secondary condition severity could be accounted for by measures of depression, Sense of Coherence and Attributional Style. The second study, a quasi-experimental treatment evaluation, indicated that a health promotion intervention for people with spinal cord injury based on these models resulted in a 37% decrease in reported limitation due to secondary conditions in the treatment group. Combined, the results from these two studies suggest a promising treatment paradigm for conducting health promotion with people who have disabilities. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","['Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Health promotion', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Psychological intervention', 'Population', 'Clinical psychology', 'Promotion (chess)', 'Health psychology', 'Mental health', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychiatry', 'Gerontology', 'Medicine', 'Public health', 'Nursing', 'Social psychology', 'Environmental health', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Craig Ravesloot', 'Tom Seekins', 'Quincy‐Robyn Young']",0,False,Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy,[]
Sex-Linked Carrying Styles and the Attribution of Homosexuality,2001,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224540109600579,4,"We used pairs of slides showing 3 women and 3 men displaying 2 sex linked carrying styles to examine differences in the attribution of homosexuality as a consequence of behavioral displays that are either sex typical or sex atypical.

Each of 2 groups of U.S. university students rated targets in 6 slides on homosexuality and 3 other traits. The mean difference in rated homosexuality for typical versus atypical carrying styles was small but statistically significant.

The Positive Thinking Program is a mental health promotion program based on cognitive and behavioural strategies. It is designed to meet the developmental needs of children in the middle primary school Years 4 and 5. Four state primary schools were randomly assigned to receive the program implemented by psychologists or to a control condition involving their regular Health Education curriculum. Seventy-two children participated in the intervention condition and 48 children in the control condition. Children completed measures of depressive and anxiety symptomatology, depressive disorders, and attribution style. The intervention was associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and more positive attributions at post-intervention. Compared to the control group, there was a lower prevalence of depressive disorders at posttest and fewer intervention group children developed a depressive disorder at a 9-month follow-up.","['Attribution', 'Depression (economics)', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Anxiety', 'Mental health', 'Clinical psychology', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Medicine', 'Curriculum', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics', 'Pedagogy']","['Rosanna Rooney', 'Clare Roberts', 'Robert Kane', 'Lisbeth T.

Methods: The study population consisted of the employees of 8 faculties of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (n = 647), of which 243 staff members were selected using a stratified sampling method. Data collection was performed using standard Amram Spiritual Intelligence Questionnaire, Paterson Job Performance Questionnaire and Rotter Locus of Control Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regressions using SPSS. Results: Based on Pearson correlation coefficient, SI was significantly correlated with job performance among the employees. In addition, there was a significant correlation between internal locus of control and job performance; however, external locus of control did not exhibit any correlation with job performance. Furthermore, the results showed a significant relationship between SI components and job performance (P = 0.000). The results of the regression analysis revealed that all the components of SI were predictors of variables for job performance (R2 = 0.26). Conclusion: Considering the tests, it was revealed that there is a positive and meaningful relation between the internal control of attributional style and the elements of the SI with personnel job performance. However, based on the result of the regression with the fixed amount of 26 percent, it seems necessary to pay attention to other effective elements on the performance of personnel, except internal control and elements of SI.","['Locus of control', 'Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient', 'Job performance', 'Psychology', 'Regression analysis', 'Correlation', 'Job satisfaction', 'Applied psychology', 'Data collection', 'Social psychology', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics', 'Geometry']","['Mina Jasour', 'Sadegh Maleki Avarsin']",15,True,Research and Development in Medical Education,[]

Seminal findings by Libet et al. (1983) demonstrate that subjective awareness of a voluntary urge to act (the W-judgment) occurs before action execution. Libet's paradigm requires participants to perform voluntary actions while watching a clock hand rotate. On response trials, participants make a retrospective judgment related to awareness of their urge to act. This research investigates the relationship between individual differences in performance on the Libet task and self-awareness. We examined the relationship between W-judgment, attributional style (AS; a measure of perceived control) and interoceptive sensitivity (IS; awareness of stimuli originating from one's body; e.g., heartbeats). Thirty participants completed the AS questionnaire (ASQ), a heartbeat estimation task (IS), and the Libet paradigm. The ASQ score significantly predicted performance on the Libet task, while IS did not - more negative ASQ scores indicated larger latency between W-judgment and action execution. A significant correlation was also observed between ASQ score and IS. This is the first research to report a relationship between W-judgment and AS and should inform the future use of electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the relationship between AS, W-judgment and RP onset.

The regulation of positive and negative emotions through instructed causal attributions in lifetime depression – A functional magnetic resonance imaging study,2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.10.025,36,"Adequate emotional control is essential for mental health. Deficiencies in emotion regulation are evident in many psychiatric disorders, including depression. Patients with depression show, for instance, disrupted neural emotion regulation in cognitive regulation regions such as lateral and medial prefrontal cortices. Since depressed individuals tend to attribute positive events to external circumstances and negative events to themselves, modifying this non-self-serving attributional style may represent a promising regulation strategy. Spontaneous causal attributions are generally processed in medial brain structures, particularly the precuneus. However, so far no study has investigated neural correlates of instructed causal attributions (e.g. instructing a person to intentionally relate positive events to the self) and their potential to regulate emotions. The current study therefore aimed to examine how instructed causal attributions of positive and negative events affect the emotional experience of depressed individuals as well as its neural bases. For this purpose pictures of sad and happy faces were presented to 26 patients with a lifetime major depression (MDD) and 26 healthy controls (HC) during fMRI. Participants should respond naturally (""view"") or imagine that the person on the picture was sad/happy because of them (""internal attribution"") or because something else happened (""external attribution""). Trait attributional style and depressive symptoms were assessed with questionnaires to examine potential influential factors on emotion regulation ability. Results revealed that patients compared to controls show a non-self-serving trait attributional style (i.e. more external attributions of positive events and more internal attributions of negative events). Intriguingly, when instructed to apply specific causal attributions during the emotion regulation task, patients and controls were similarly able to regulate positive and negative emotions.

The Cognitive Movement in Instruction,1979,https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189x008002005,114,"ed from the article of the same title in the Educational Psychologist, Volume 13, 1978. Copyrighted by the Division of Educational Psychology of the American Psychological Association. A cognitive approach implies that learning from instruction is scientifically more productively studied as an internally, cognitively mediated process than as a direct product of the environment, people, or factors external to the learner. The approach involves understanding relations or interactions beween the learners' cognitive processes and aptitudes, such as attribution, motivation, encoding, memory, cognitive styles and cognitive structures, and the characteristics of instructional treatments. The cognitive movement thus brings a unity of interest to people who study individual differences, learning and instruction, and a unifying synthesis to many recent research findings (Bandura, 1969). It also encourages research on comprehension, understanding, and transfer, several areas of fundamental importance to education. In educational research, a cognitive approach implies that it is more useful and meaningful to study, for example, how teaching style influences the learners' attention, motivation, and understanding, which in turn influence behavior, than it is useful and meaningful to study how teaching style directly influences student behavior. A cognitive model emphasizes the active and constructive role of the learner. From this point of view, the art of instruction begins with an understanding and a diagnosis of the cognitive and affective processes and aptitudes of the learners. From these one designs different treatments for different students in different situations to actively induce mental elaborations that relate previous learning and schemata to stimuli. In this conception the learners are active, responsible, and accountable for their role in generative learning.

The Effect of Realistic Appearance of Virtual Characters in Immersive Environments - Does the Character's Personality Play a Role?,2018,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2018.2794638,114,"Virtual characters that appear almost photo-realistic have been shown to induce negative responses from viewers in traditional media, such as film and video games. This effect, described as the uncanny valley, is the reason why realism is often avoided when the aim is to create an appealing virtual character. In Virtual Reality, there have been few attempts to investigate this phenomenon and the implications of rendering virtual characters with high levels of realism on user enjoyment. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale experiment on over one thousand members of the public in order to gather information on how virtual characters are perceived in interactive virtual reality games. We were particularly interested in whether different render styles (realistic, cartoon, etc.) would directly influence appeal, or if a character's personality was the most important indicator of appeal. We used a number of perceptual metrics such as subjective ratings, proximity, and attribution bias in order to test our hypothesis. Our main result shows that affinity towards virtual characters is a complex interaction between the character's appearance and personality, and that realism is in fact a positive choice for virtual characters in virtual reality.","['Uncanny valley', 'Realism', 'Virtual reality', 'Computer science', 'Character (mathematics)', 'Rendering (computer graphics)', 'Immersion (mathematics)', 'Personality', 'Perception', 'Human–computer interaction', 'Appeal', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Art', 'Mathematics', 'Geometry', 'Literature', 'Neuroscience', 'Pure mathematics', 'Political science', 'Robot', 'Law']","['Katja Zibrek', 'Elena Kokkinara', 'Rachel McDonnell']",45,False,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,['Science Foundation Ireland']

Source Code Authorship Attribution Using Hybrid Approach of Program Dependence Graph and Deep Learning Model,2019,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2019.2943639,46,"Source Code Authorship Attribution (SCAA) is to find the real author of source code in a corpus. Though, it is a privacy threat to open-source programmers, but, it may be significantly helpful to develop forensic based applications. Such as, ghostwriting detection, copyright dispute settlements, and other code analysis applications. The efficient features extraction is the key challenge for classifying real authors of specific source codes. In this paper, the Program Dependence Graph with Deep Learning (PDGDL) methodology is proposed to identify authors from different programming source codes. First, the PDG is implemented to extract control and data dependencies from source codes. Second, the preprocessing technique is applied to convert PDG features into small instances with frequency details. Third, the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) technique is used to zoom the importance of each PDG feature in source code. Fourth, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to tackle the class imbalance problem. Finally, the deep learning algorithm is applied to extract coding styles' features for each programmer and to attribute the real authors. The deep learning algorithm is further fine-tuned with drop out layer, learning error rate, loss and activation function, and dense layers for better accuracy of results. The proposed work is analyzed on 1000 programmers' data, collected from Google Code Jam (GCJ). The dataset contains three different programming languages, i.e., C++, Java, C#.

Along with methodological development, stylistics has expanded its scope into new areas of application such as authorship profiling and sentiment analysis in addition to conventional areas such as authorship attribution and genre‐based text classification. Among these, computational sociolinguistics, which aims at providing a systematic and solid basis for sociolinguistic analysis using machine learning and linguistically‐motivated features, is a potentially important area. In this study we showed the effectiveness of the random forests classifier for such tasks by applying it to Japanese prime ministers' Diet speeches. The results demonstrated that our method successfully extracted the speaker‐specific expressions of two Japanese prime ministers, and enabled us to investigate their political styles in a systematic manner. The method can be applied to sociolinguistic analysis of various other types of texts, and in this way, this study will contribute to developing the area of computational sociolinguistics.","['Sociolinguistics', 'Random forest', 'Computer science', 'Politics', 'Linguistics', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Prime (order theory)', 'Mathematics', 'Political science', 'Philosophy', 'Combinatorics', 'Law']",['Takafumi Suzuki'],33,False,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,[]
Cognitive Features Associated With Depressive Symptoms in Adolescence: Directionality and Specificity,2007,https://doi.org/10.1080/15374410701274926,79,"In this study we examined cognitive features that have been posited to contribute to depressive vulnerability in adolescents.

Depression in the Chinese: the impact of acculturation,2005,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291705005623,111,"Background. Studies of depression in the Chinese have long identified low rates and a greater likelihood of somatization, findings which could reflect cultural influences or real differences. We report a study from a western region examining the impact of acculturation on depression to clarify the role of cultural factors. Method. In a Sydney-based study, Chinese subjects ( n =385) and a matched control group of 143 non-Chinese subjects completed either a Chinese or English questionnaire assessing state and lifetime depression, attributional style, depression recognition and help-seeking. The impact of acculturation was examined by several strategies. Results. Any tendency by the Chinese to somatize depression appeared to be attenuated by acculturation. State depression levels countered the view that Chinese necessarily deny depression. Lifetime depression rate differences were also attenuated by acculturation, with Chinese subjects being less likely than controls to judge episodes as a distinct disorder and to seek professional help. Conclusions. Results suggest that Australian Chinese do not differ intrinsically in recognizing and ascribing depressive symptoms, and that the greater the degree of acculturation, the greater the tendency for reporting persistent and impairing depressive episodes.","['Acculturation', 'Somatization', 'Depression (economics)', 'Psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Psychiatry', 'Mental health', 'Immigration', 'Anxiety', 'History', 'Macroeconomics', 'Archaeology', 'Economics']","['Gordon Parker', 'Bibiana Chan', 'Lucy A.

Information-processing and perceptions of control: How attribution style affects task-relevant processing.,2007,,5,"This study investigated the effects of perceived controllability on information processing within Weiner’s (1985, 1986) attributional model of learning. Attributional style was used to identify trait patterns of controllability for 37 university students. Task-relevant feedback on an information-processing task was then manipulated to test for differences in working memory function between participants with high versus low levels of trait controllability. Processing efficiency occurred differently for hi-trait and lo-trait types. Results supported the hypothesis that trait controllability exerts a moderating effect on the way task-relevant feedback is processed. A selective encoding of information was evident, involving processing limitations inherent to the working memory system.

The Relationship Between Quality of Life and Self-esteem and Attribution Styles in Primary School Students,2016,https://doi.org/10.5812/ijpbs.5850,4,"Background: Quality of life, self-esteem and attribution styles have important effects on people's individual and social functions. Through determining the interactional relations of these factors, parents and schools can plan to change each one of them and improve their children's functions. Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate the interactional relations among students' quality of life, self-esteem and attribution styles. Methods: The research sample included 365 primary school students (154 boys and 211 girls), who were selected through random cluster sampling. They filled in the questionnaire after each item was read by their teacher. Research tools included three questionnaires including Sieberer's quality of life, Seligman's attribution styles and Rosenberg's self-esteem questionnaires. Statistical analyses were conducted by Pearson correlation and analysis of regression. Results: The results indicated that there was a significant positive relationship among dimensions of quality of life (except for physical well-being and peers relation and support) and self-esteem. Furthermore, there was a significant negative relationship between self-esteem and negative mood (from components of quality of life) and all components of quality of life were significant predictors of self-esteem. On the other hand, self-esteem was the greatest predictor of negative mood (0.13) and efficiency in the school environment (0.02) (from components of quality of life) (P = 0.01). The results also showed that there were significant positive correlations among optimistic attribution style, self-perception and peers relation and support (from components of quality of life). Conclusions: Since variables of negative mood and efficiency at the school environment were effective factors on self-esteem and, optimistic attribution style was affected by peers relation and support, educational planning for each indicator can improve the quality of life of primary school students.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Self-esteem', 'Quality of life (healthcare)', 'Mood', 'Cluster sampling', 'Social psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Medicine', 'Population', 'Environmental health', 'Psychotherapist']","['Yahya Kazemi', 'Zahra Nikmanesh', 'Masome Khosravi']",20,True,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,[]
POLITICAL IDENTITY AND SUPPORT FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: A TEST OF ATTRIBUTION THEORY,2006,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648x.2006.9721217,55,"ABSTRACT Studies of public support for capital punishment have consistently observed modest relationships between both political ideology and party affiliation and support for the death penalty; conservatives and Republicans are more inclined to support capital punishment than are liberals and Democrats.

This study employs the theoretical rubrics of political socialization and identity formation and attribution theory to account for this relationship.

Responses by 85 female victims of intimate partner violence indicated that their overall readiness to terminate a relationship was predicted by a preoccupied attachment style and high emotional arousal. However, women's low level of anger predicted their precontemplation of change, the earliest stage of readiness, whereas internalizing emotional difficulties and preoccupation with their batterer predicted maintenance, the final stage of readiness to persist in their decision to leave their abuser.

Effectiveness of preventive family intervention in improving cognitive attributions among children of depressed parents: A randomized study.,2013,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0033466,49,"Our randomized trial examined the effectiveness of preventive interventions in increasing positive cognitive attributions and reducing negative cognitive attributions in children of depressed parents. In addition, it tested the role of attribution changes in mediating the intervention effects on children's depressive and emotional symptoms. The participants were 109 Finnish families with at least one parent in treatment for affective disorder, for a total of 145 children, 8-16 years of age. Families were randomized into two groups: the ""family talk intervention"" (FTI, a whole-family approach enhancing communication and child resilience, Beardslee et al., 1997) group, and an active control, the ""let's talk about the children"" (LTC, a parent-only psycho-educational approach, Solantaus, Paavonen, Toikka, & Punamäki, 2010) group. Children reported their cognitive attributions (CASQ-R, Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire-Revised (Thompson, Kaslow, Weiss, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1998)), depressive (CDI/BDI, Child Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1981)/Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988)) and emotional (SDQ, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997)) symptoms, and mothers reported their children's emotional symptoms (SDQ at baseline (T1) and 10-month (T2) and 18-month (T3)) follow-ups. Contrary to our hypothesis, no beneficial attribution changes were found in the FTI group across the follow-ups. Instead, positive cognitive appraisals increased in the LTC group, especially from T2 to T3. The increase of positive attribution further served as a mediator for changes in children's emotional and depressive symptoms.

Communication style drives emergent leadership attribution in virtual teams,2023,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1095131,4,"Leader selection plays a key role in how human social groups are formed and maintained. Leadership is either assigned through formal processes within an organization, or emerges informally through interactions with other group members-particularly in novel contexts. COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of virtual meetings and more flexible team structures. However our understanding of how assigned leadership influences subsequent leadership emergence in virtual settings is limited. Here we examine the relationship between assigned leadership within an existing organization and subsequent emergent leadership attributions as members engage in virtual interactions. To do so, we created and implemented a novel virtual group decision-making task designed to support quantification of a more comprehensive set of communication style elements, such as speech dynamics and facial expressions, as well as task behaviors. Sixteen members of a real world organization engaged four repeated rounds of a group decision making task with new team members each time. We found participants made novel attributions of emergent leadership rather than relying solely on existing assigned leadership. While assigned leadership did influence leadership attributions, communication style, including amount of speech but also variability in facial expressions, played a larger role. The behavior of these novel emergent leaders was also more consistent with expectations of leadership behavior: they spoke earlier, more often, and focused more on the correct decision than did assigned leaders. These findings suggest that, even within existing social networks, virtual contexts promote flexible group structures that depend more on communication style and task performance than assigned leadership.","['Psychology', 'Leadership style', 'Attribution', 'Shared leadership', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Task (project management)', 'Social psychology', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Virtual team', 'Communication in small groups', 'Selection (genetic algorithm)', 'Applied psychology', 'Knowledge management', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Management', 'Archaeology', 'Economics', 'History', 'Programming language']","['Scott M.

Changes in Style in Authors with Alzheimer's Disease,2012,https://doi.org/10.1080/0013838x.2012.668789,35,"Abstract Even in its very early stages, Alzheimer's disease leads to changes in language that can be detected by computational analysis. These changes may include a reduced, vaguer, and more abstract vocabulary, and reduced syntactic complexity. But do these changes affect an author's essential style? We experiment with a number of standard features for authorship attribution and authorship verification to see whether they recognize late works written by authors known to have had Alzheimer's disease as being by the same author as their earlier works. The authors whom we study are Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie. Our control author (without Alzheimer's) is P. D. James. Our results were equivocal, as different frameworks yielded contrary results, but an SVM classifier was able to make age discriminations, or nearly so, for all three authors, thereby casting doubt on the underlying axiom that an author's essential style is invariant in the absence of cognitive decline.

Maternal child-centered attributions and harsh discipline: The moderating role of maternal working memory across socioeconomic contexts.,2014,https://doi.org/10.1037/fam0000023,64,"Cognitive models of parenting give emphasis to the central role that parental cognitions may play in parental socialization goals. In particular, dual process models suggest that parental attribution styles affect the way parents interpret caregiving situations and enact behaviors, particularly within the realm of discipline. Although research has documented the negative behavioral repercussions of dysfunctional child-centered responsibility biases, there is heterogeneity in the level of these associations. Research has also demonstrated that parental working memory capacity may serve as an individual difference factor in influencing caregiving behaviors. Thus, our first aim was to document how maternal working memory capacity may moderate the association between mother's dysfunctional child-oriented attributions and use of harsh discipline. In addition, from an ecological perspective, a second aim was to examine how socioeconomic risk may further potentiate the impact of maternal working memory. To accomplish these aims, a socioeconomically diverse sample of 185 mothers and their 3-year old children were recruited to participate in a laboratory-based research assessment. Findings revealed that lower maternal working memory capacity may operate as a risk factor for attributional biases and harsh discipline, and higher working memory may serve as a protective factor in this relationship. Socioeconomic risk further moderated these findings. Results suggest that the moderating role of working memory may be particularly pronounced under conditions of socioeconomic risk. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Psychology', 'Socioeconomic status', 'Dysfunctional family', 'Attribution', 'Developmental psychology', 'Working memory', 'Affect (linguistics)', 'Socialization', 'Cognition', 'Association (psychology)', 'Social psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Population', 'Sociology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Demography', 'Communication', 'Neuroscience']","['Melissa L.

Cognitive Factors Related to Suicidal Ideation and Resolution in Psychiatrically Hospitalized Children and Adolescents,2000,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.12.2017,32,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine whether there are changes in the cognitive factors of attributional style, hopelessness, and self-esteem when suicidal ideation fades in psychiatrically hospitalized children and adolescents. METHOD: The cognitive factors of attributional style, hopelessness, and self-esteem were assessed in subjects aged 7–17 years (50 with and 50 without suicidal ideation) at admission and discharge from a psychiatric hospital. RESULTS: For subjects with suicidal ideation, attributional style became significantly more positive and hopelessness was decreased from admission to discharge, by which time suicidal ideation had faded. There was no association between self-esteem and suicidal ideation after control for depression. These changes in cognitive factors were not seen in the group without suicidal ideation. There were no significant differences between children and adolescents in the pattern of results. CONCLUSIONS: Change in attributional style was shown to be a factor significantly related to the resolution of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents. This cognitive style could be specifically addressed in psychotherapy with depressed children and adolescents as a means of reducing suicidal ideation. These results may have an implication for reducing the length of psychiatric inpatient stays.","['Suicidal ideation', 'Psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive style', 'Psychiatry', 'Depression (economics)', 'Ideation', 'Attribution', 'Self-esteem', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Poison control', 'Medicine', 'Medical emergency', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics', 'Cognitive science']","['Karen Dineen Wagner', 'Mark Rouleau', 'Thomas E.

Teasing Out Authorship and Style with T-tests and Zeta,2010,,11,"Most computational stylistics methods were developed for authorship attribution, but many have also been applied to the study of style. Investigating Wilkie Collin's Blind Love (1890), left unfinished at his death and completed by Walter Besant from a long synopsis and notes provided by Collins, requires both authorship attribution and stylistics. External evidence indicates that Besant took over after chapter 48 (Collins 2003), which provides an opportunity to test whether Besant was successful in matching Collins's style and to investigate the styles of Collins and Besant. This divided novel also facilitates the comparison of two computational methods: the T-test and Burrows's Zeta. The t-test is a well-studied method for determining the probability of a difference between two groups arising by chance (a classic use in authorship and stylistics is Burrows 1992.) Here I use t-tests to identify words used very differently by Collins and Besant. After showing that those word frequencies accurately identify the change of authorship, I examine the words themselves for stylistically interesting characteristics. I created a combined word frequency list for four novels by Besant and three by Collins, then deleted words occurring only once or twice, personal pronouns (too closely related to the number and gender of characters), all words with more than 90% of their occurrences in one text (almost exclusively proper names), and words limited to one author (required for t-testing). I divided the novels into 167 4,000-word sections, and performed t-tests for the remaining 6,600 words (using a Minitab macro). I cleaned up the results and sorted them on the p value in Excel (with another macro), and retained only the 1719 words with p < .05, about 1,000 for Collins and 700 for Besant","['Style (visual arts)', 'Stylistics', 'Attribution', 'Test (biology)', 'Word (group theory)', 'Stylometry', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Biology']",['David L.

Elite Athletes’ Perfectionistic Striving vs. Concerns as Opposing Predictors of Self-Handicapping With the Mediating Role of Attributional Style,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.862122,6,"Self-handicapping is not only present among amateurs, but also even among the most elite athletes. The vast majority of the research investigates self-handicapping in academic context among students with mediocre performance. However, scientific examinations of predictors among top performers in the field of sports is terra incognita. Among the predictors of self-handicapping, perfectionistic strivings, and concerns as well as attributional style, were demonstrated as relevant ones among samples in prior studies. However, these links have never been examined among elite athletes who can be characterized by various aspects of perfectionism. In this study, the link between self-handicapping and perfectionistic striving and concerns was examined both directly and indirectly through the potential mediating effect of attributional style among elite athletes ( N = 111) where more than half of the participants was competing at international level such as European and World Championships or Olympic Games. As it was expected, a positive relationship was found between perfectionistic concerns and self-handicapping, whereas the findings suggested a negative relationship between perfectionistic striving and self-handicapping. These connections were partially mediated by attributions for negative sport-related events. It appears that explanations for negative events are crucial in connection with protecting oneself through self-handicapping even among top athletes. The present work is a first step of a broader program in which the goal is reducing self-handicapping of top athletes through attributional retraining intervention.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Athletes', 'Perfectionism (psychology)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Elite', 'Social psychology', 'Elite athletes', 'Intervention (counseling)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Clinical psychology', 'Medicine', 'Paleontology', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Psychiatry', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Biology', 'Physical therapy']","['Lilla Török', 'Zsolt Péter Szabó', 'Gábor Orosz']",55,True,Frontiers in Psychology,[]

Discriminating between chronic fatigue syndrome and depression: a cognitive analysis,2001,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291701003610,85,"Background. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and depression share a number of common symptoms and the majority of CFS patients meet lifetime criteria for depression. While cognitive factors seem key to the maintenance of CFS and depression, little is known about how the cognitive characteristics differ in the two conditions.Methods. Fifty-three CFS patients were compared with 20 depressed patients and 38 healthy controls on perceptions of their health, illness attributions, self-esteem, cognitive distortions of general and somatic events, symptoms of distress and coping. A 6 month follow-up was also conducted to determine the stability of these factors and to investigate whether CFS-related cognitions predict ongoing disability and fatigue in this disorder.Results. Between-group analyses confirmed that the depressed group was distinguished by low self-esteem, the propensity to make cognitive distortions across all situations, and to attribute their illness to psychological factors. In contrast, the CFS patients were characterized by low ratings of their current health status, a strong illness identity, external attributions for their illness, and distortions in thinking that were specific to somatic experiences. They were also more likely than depressed patients to cope with their illness by limiting stress and activity levels. These CFS-related cognitions and behaviours were associated with disability and fatigue 6 months later.Conclusions. CFS and depression can be distinguished by unique cognitive styles characteristic of each condition.

Poor me versus bad me paranoia and the instability of persecutory ideation,2006,https://doi.org/10.1348/147608305x52856,74,"Objectives. To investigate whether there are two stable types of paranoia, ‘poor me’ and ‘bad me’, as described by Trower and Chadwick (1995) , and whether beliefs about the deservedness of persecution are associated with psychological measures. Methods. In‐patients experiencing persecutory delusions were assigned either to ‘poor me’ (PM) or ‘bad me’(BM) groups, according to their rating of a perceived deservedness scale, which was repeated on subsequent assessments. Participants were assessed for depression (BDI); construction of the self (Self‐to‐Others Scale); autonomy and sociotropy (PSI); perceived parental behaviour (PBI); attributional style (ASQ) and, meaningful daily events (DEI, devised for the study). A healthy control group was also assessed. Results. Many patients' perceived deservedness of persecution varied across time, so that some patients were PM at one point in time but BM at another.

Effects of attributional style and perceived physical competence on sport behavior : An examination of causal attribution model about sport behavior of university students,1987,https://doi.org/10.5432/jjpehss.kj00003392283,4,"The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of causal attribution model about Sport behavior of university students. This model assumes the caudal process as follows: (1)attributional style influences degree of perceived physical competence each student has ; (2) the degree of perceived physical competence influences magnitude of sport behavior he/she takes. First, two questionaires designed to measure attributional style in sport situations and physical competence were developed and administered to 129 university students. By factor analysis, 7 and 2 factors were interpreted in each questionaire, and the 7 and 2 scales of these factors were set. These scales were named as follows : ""positive, negative-task"", ""positive, negative-mood"", ""positive-ability"", ""positive, negative-1uck"", ""negative-ability"", ""positive-effort"", ""negative-effort"", ""perceived physical ability""; and ""perceived control"". The reliability of these scales were tested by the coefficientαand the coefficient of test-retest reliability, and credible results were obtained. Then, according to the model, a path analysis was applied to the data obtained in two questionaires and the two indexes of sport behavior. The validity of the model was mainly confirmed. It was found that the scale of positive-ability, negative-ability, and perceived physical ability play the central role in mediating sport behavior. It was also found that different causal paths were showed in two indexes of sport behavior. They were discussed in terms of the differences of achievement goal in each sport behavior.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Competence (human resources)', 'Social psychology', 'Path analysis (statistics)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Mood', 'Statistics', 'Mathematics']",['Toyohiko Ito'],0,True,Taiikugaku kenkyu (Japan Journal of Physical Education Health and Sport Sciences),[]
The Role of Locus of Control and Attributional Style in Coping Strategies and Quality of Life among Iranian Breast Cancer and Colorectal Cancer Patients: A Pilot Study,2014,,6,"Background: The influence of various psychological factors and coping mechanisms on quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients has been well established. We evaluated locus of control and attributional styles, and their association with coping styles and quality of life (QOL) among Iranian cancer patients.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with breast cancer and patients with colorectal cancer in stage I to III. Patients were assessed for demographic and disease characteristics, cancer-related symptoms, locus of control, attributional styles, coping styles, and QOL.
Results: From 140 invited patients, 100 patients participated in the study. Data of 55 patients with breast cancer and 22 patients with colorectal cancer were appropriate and included for analysis (mean age of 47.5 ± 7.9 years, 89.6% female). Factors positively associated with QOL included educational level, internal locus of control, overall hopefulness, and confrontive, optimistic, and self-reliant coping styles (r = 0.228 to 0.426). Factors negatively associated with QOL included age, symptoms severity, overall hopelessness, and fatalistic and emotive coping styles (r = -0.221 to -0.674). Internal locus of control and hopefulness were associated with confrontive/adaptive coping styles (r = 0.226 to 0.381), while external locus of control and hopelessness were associated with evasive/maladaptive coping styles (r = 0.208 to 0.381).
Conclusion: These results indicate that internal locus of control, hopefulness, and positive attributional styles are associated with more adaptive/confrontive coping strategies and better QOL in Iranian cancer patients. Further studies with more comprehensive psychosocial evaluation in a larger sample of cancer patients are warranted.","['Breast cancer', 'Locus of control', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Oncology', 'Medicine', 'Life style', 'Clinical psychology', 'Psychology', 'Internal medicine', 'Cancer', 'Psychotherapist']","['Farzad Goli', 'Carl Eduard Scheidt', 'Ali Gholamrezaei', 'Mahboubeh Farzanegan']",30,False,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),[]
Investigating the Relationship Between Attribution Styles and Metacognitive Skills With Fear of Success Among Students,2017,https://doi.org/10.5812/ijpbs.9461,4,"Background: Fear of success is a stressful factor that is derived from achievement. A few children and adults have a fear of success and as a result restrict their contributions despite their skills. Objectives: The present paper aimed at investigating the relationship between attribution styles and metacognitive skills and fear of success. Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study conducted on a statistical population of all students of 3 universities of National, Azad, and Payam-e Noor of Bojnourd, Iran, in the first 6 months of 2015. In the present study, 385 students were selected through clustering random sampling, and 3 questionnaires of Zukerman and Ellison's Fear of Success, Peterson and Seligman's Attribution Styles, and Wells' MetaCognition were distributed among the students. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. Results: Results of the regression revealed that in the best model of prediction, cognitive confidence, positive attributions, uncontrollability, and risk are able to predict the fear of success variable (P ≤ 0.05.01). With respect to Pearson's correlation coefficient, a significant negative relationship was obtained between positive attribution style and fear of success (P ≤ 0.0005), and only negative stable attributions had a significant relationship with fear of success (P ≤ 0.01). In addition, a significant relationship was detected between cognitive confidence, uncontrollability, and risk (P ≤ 0.0005), positive beliefs about concern, and fear of success.

Authorship Attribution for a Resource Poor Language—Urdu,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3487061,10,"Authorship attribution refers to examining the writing style of authors to determine the likelihood of the original author of a document from a given set of potential authors. Due to the wide range of authorship attribution applications, a plethora of studies have been conducted for various Western, as well as Asian, languages. However, authorship attribution research in the Urdu language has just begun, although Urdu is widely acknowledged as a prominent South Asian language. Furthermore, the existing studies on authorship attribution in Urdu have addressed a considerably easier problem of having less than 20 candidate authors, which is far from the real-world settings. Therefore, the findings from these studies may not be applicable to the real-world settings. To that end, we have made three key contributions: First, we have developed a large authorship attribution corpus for Urdu, which is a low-resource language. The corpus is composed of over 2.6 million tokens and 21,938 news articles by 94 authors, which makes it a closer substitute to the real-world settings. Second, we have analyzed hundreds of stylometry features used in the literature to identify 194 features that are applicable to the Urdu language and developed a taxonomy of these features. Finally, we have performed 66 experiments using two heterogeneous datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of four traditional and three deep learning techniques. The experimental results show the following: (a) Our developed corpus is many folds larger than the existing corpora, and it is more challenging than its counterparts for the authorship attribution task, and (b) Convolutional Neutral Networks is the most effective technique, as it achieved a nearly perfect F1 score of 0.989 for an existing corpus and 0.910 for our newly developed corpus.","['Stylometry', 'Authorship attribution', 'Urdu', 'Attribution', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Resource (disambiguation)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Taxonomy (biology)', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Social psychology', 'Computer network', 'Philosophy', 'Botany', 'Biology', 'Programming language', 'Archaeology']","['Zulqarnain Nazir', 'Khurram Shahzad', 'Muhammad Kamran Malik', 'Waheed Anwar', 'Imran Sarwar Bajwa', 'Khawar Mehmood']",44,False,ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing,[]

In the present study, the authors examined different pathways through which social, cognitive, and genetic risk factors may be expressed to influence depressive symptoms in 300 pairs of child twins from a longitudinal study. Path analysis supported several indirect routes. First, risks associated with living in a step- or single-parent family and punitive parenting did not directly influence depressive outcome but were instead mediated through maternal depressive symptoms and child negative attributional style. Second, the effects of negative attributional style on depressive outcome were greatly exacerbated in the presence of precipitating negative life events. Third, independent of these social and cognitive risk mechanisms, modest genetic effects were also implicated in symptoms, with some indication that these risks are expressed through exposure to negative stressors. Together, these routes accounted for approximately 13% of total phenotypic variance in depressive symptoms. Theoretical and analytical implications of these results are discussed in the context of several design-related caveats.","['Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Stressor', 'Attribution', 'Cognition', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Social environment', 'Clinical psychology', 'Social stress', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Paleontology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Biology']","['Jennifer Y.

Through determining interactional relations among these factors, parents and schools can plan for improving students’ performances.
Objectives: Hence, this study aimed to investigate the relationship of self-esteem and attributional styles with self-handicapping among primary school students.
Methods: The statistical population of this study comprised of 3rd to 5th grades of primary school students in Zahedan, during the 2015 - 2016 academic year. The research sample consisted of 365 primary students (154 boys and 211 girls) aged 9 to 11 years old who were selected using the random cluster sampling method. The research measurement tools were the Seligman et al. Children’s attributional style questionnaire, the rosenberg self-esteem scale, and the Midgley et al. self-handicapping scale. The statistical analyses were performed via SPSS 16using both descriptive and inferential statistics including the correlation test and the Inter regression analysis.
Results: The descriptive results indicated that the means of the pessimistic (9.15), optimistic (9.39) attribution styles, and self-handicapping (7.11) among the students were lower than the nominal mean of the questionnaires, however, the mean of self-esteem (31.20) was higher than the nominal mean score. Furthermore, results showed that self-handicapping was significantly and positively related to the pessimistic attribution style and it was significantly and negatively correlated with self-esteem. In addition, the results of the regression analysis showed that self-handicapping was a negative predictor of self-esteem (P ≤ 0.001) and was a positive predictor of the pessimistic attributional style (P = 0.03).

Aggressors are seen as attributing their violent behavior to external causes, whether by projecting their negative traits onto their spouses or by finding excuses which blame temporary environmental factors. In contrast, victims often attribute the abuse to defects within themselves or situational factors affecting their spouses. The attribution process seems affected by the frequency, intensity and duration of the abuse, with temporal factors playing an important role in the woman's internalizing style. Furthermore, inadequate early coping efforts play a powerful role in establishing cognitive‐perceptual patterns that serve to perpetuate the abuse.","['Attribution', 'Blame', 'Spouse', 'Situational ethics', 'Psychology', 'Causality (physics)', 'Perception', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Social psychology', 'Clinical psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience', 'Sociology', 'Anthropology']","['James C.

Predicting Optimal Outcomes in Cognitive Therapy or Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Individuals Using the Personalized Advantage Index Approach,2015,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140771,180,"Introduction Although psychotherapies for depression produce equivalent outcomes, individual patients respond differently to different therapies. Predictors of outcome have been identified in the context of randomized trials, but this information has not been used to predict which treatment works best for the depressed individual. In this paper, we aim to replicate a recently developed treatment selection method, using data from an RCT comparing the effects of cognitive therapy (CT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Methods 134 depressed patients completed the pre- and post-treatment BDI-II assessment. First, we identified baseline predictors and moderators. Second, individual treatment recommendations were generated by combining the identified predictors and moderators in an algorithm that produces the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), a measure of the predicted advantage in one therapy compared to the other, using standard regression analyses and the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Results We found five predictors (gender, employment status, anxiety, personality disorder and quality of life) and six moderators (somatic complaints, cognitive problems, paranoid symptoms, interpersonal self-sacrificing, attributional style and number of life events) of treatment outcome. The mean average PAI value was 8.9 BDI points, and 63% of the sample was predicted to have a clinically meaningful advantage in one of the therapies. Those who were randomized to their predicted optimal treatment (either CT or IPT) had an observed mean end-BDI of 11.8, while those who received their predicted non-optimal treatment had an end-BDI of 17.8 (effect size for the difference = 0.51). Discussion Depressed patients who were randomized to their predicted optimal treatment fared much better than those randomized to their predicted non-optimal treatment.

Walton FICTION, FICTION-MAKING, AND STYLES OF FICTIONALITY Both objectsandactions are said to have styles. Styles eire attributed to works of art, bathing suits, neckties, and automobiles. But we also think of styles as ways of doing things. There are styles of teaching, styles of chess playing, styles of travel. The primary notion of style is the one which attaches to actions. When we speak of die style of a poem or a portrait or em automobile we do so with reference to an action or actions associated with the object, usually the action or actions which appear to have been performed in die making of it. I will not argue now for this claim about style except to note that style attributions eure peculietrly alien to objects which are not products of human action. What is the style of a tulip, or an alpine meadow, or a pristine lake in the high Sierras? Are the Grand Canyon and Yosemite Valley in the same style or different ones? Sunsets in the tropics are very different from sunsets in the arctic, but is die difference a stylistic one? We might allow that in unusual cases natured objects can have styles.

The authors demonstrate these methods with algorithmic descriptions of the styles ofRichard Diehenkorn and Joan Mir6 and the generation of new compositions in their styles. A shape grammar algorithm for Diebenkorn is presented which accounts for the linear facture of his Ocean Park series. The problem of shape inMir6's work is tackled, and progress isreported on synthesizing composition in the style of his Constellation series. Further uses of algorithmic description ofpainting styles include mechanical storage, search and retrieval in art archives, attribution studies and diachronic studies of stylistic change.","['Style (visual arts)', 'Painting', 'Computer science', 'Computer graphics (images)', 'Visual arts', 'Art', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Medicine']","['Joan L.

In this study, the author attribution of a text is based on the differentiation of phonostatistical structures of styles.We have developed a system of differentiation of phonostatistical structures of styles, which differs from the existing ones by the chosen level of a language ‒ phonological. At this level of a language one can obtain results with a greater accuracy. In addition, the system constructed is based on a modular principle, which makes it possible to rapidly modify the developed software.We have developed methods and models that are based on the theory of mathematical statistics and allow the improvement in the accuracy of differentiation of phonostatistical structures of styles. A method was devised for a comprehensive analysis of phonostatistical structures of styles, as well as a multifactor method for determining the degrees of action of factors related to style, substyle, and author's manner of presentation. We have constructed a statistical model of stylistic differentiation using the ranking method, and a statistical model for determining a general stylistic markedness of the examined text. A software system for the differentiation of texts was designed.The criterion for the differentiation of texts is the mean frequencies of groups of consonant phonemes.In the process of implementing a system we used the programming language java, which ensures that the software is platform-independent.This study reports results of the application of the developed methods, models, and software tools.

Delusional discourse: An investigation comparing the spontaneous causal attributions of paranoid and non‐paranoid individuals,2004,https://doi.org/10.1348/1476083042555361,25,"Research into the nature of attributional reasoning in paranoia has for the most part been restricted to questionnaire-based approaches. This fails to address the issue of whether a distinctive attributional style underpins the everyday talk of paranoid individuals. This study aimed to investigate whether attributional models of paranoid delusions applied to spontaneous attributions generated in the discourse of 12 paranoid and 12 non-paranoid speakers. Causal attributions for negative and positive life experiences were extracted from interview transcripts and rated using the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations (CAVE) technique. It was found that, as a proportion, paranoids made more attributions for negative events that were of an external-personal, stable and global nature (as attributional models would predict). They also made significantly more external-personal attributions for negative events and, in one of two datasets, showed a more external mean CAVE rating for negative events than the non-paranoid controls. This paper highlights important issues underlying the extraction of attributions from paranoid talk, and discusses the implications for attributional models of paranoia and future discourse-based research in this area.","['Paranoia', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Paranoid schizophrenia', 'Paranoid Disorders', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychosis']","['David A.

Subjects who perceived the cause of their first substance abuse (whether alcohol or another drug of abuse) as global and likely to affect substance abuse in the future also were more successful in completing the program. Not surprisingly, subjects who indicated that the cause of their quitting substance abuse was likely to lead them to stay off their drug of abuse in the future were more successful in completing the program.

At present, the research on the influencing factors of employee service innovation behavior is increasing. This study, based on the social cognitive theory, with relative deprivation as the mediator and attribution style as the moderator, explores the mechanism of the effect of organizational fairness on employee service innovation behavior. Taking 342 employees of service-oriented enterprises as the subjects of investigation, this paper empirically tests the theoretical model by using Amos and SPSS. The results indicated the following, organizational fairness was positively related to employees' service innovation behavior. Relative deprivation partially mediated the relationship between organizational fairness and service innovation behavior. An external attribution style positively moderated the relationship between relative deprivation and employee service innovation behavior. An external attribution style also positively moderated the mediation effect of the relationship between organizational fairness and service innovation behavior. The internal attribution style negatively moderated the relationship between relative deprivation and employee service innovation behavior.

Women with ADHD symptomatology had more uncontrollable, stable, and global attributions, reported more dissatisfaction in their childhood parent, peer, and teacher relationships, and felt less in control of negative childhood events as compared with the nonADHD women. Both depression and ADHD contributed significantly to these group differences, suggesting that negative perceptions and attributions are more than reflections of current thinking and mood.

Explanations given for why there are poor people in America may reveal much about underlying structured inequality legitimating mechanisms. Using multiple regression, one-way ANOVA, and frequency distribution analyses, I uncover a conservative-liberal continuum underlying American poverty cause attributions. Past explanations for the mostly mixed nature of American attributions toward poverty are questioned. I suggest a more simple and straightforward explanation: mixed attribution styles, situated on a conservative-liberal continuum, may arise from American's distinguishing between at least two groups of poor people—""deserving"" and ""undeserving""—suggesting policy and future research agendas.

Prevention of Depressive Symptoms in Schoolchildren: A Research Update,1999,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00188,119,"Recent research suggests that cognitive vulnerabilities implicated in adult depression are relevant to depression in children, at least by middle childhood. For example, a pessimistic explanatory style is associated with depressive symptoms in children and has been found to predict depressive symptoms in some studies (for reviews, see Gladstone & Kaslow, 1995; Joiner & Wagner, 1995). Intervention programs that target these cognitive vulnerabilities are effective in treating and preventing depression symptoms and episodes (Clarke et al., 1995; Gillham, Reivich, Jaycox, & Seligman, 1995; Lewinsohn, Clarke, & Rohde, 1994). Clarke and colleagues found a prevention effect that lasted through 12 months of follow-up. Little is known about the even longer-term benefits of such programs. Do children who participate in these programs continue to benefit throughout their school years, or do the effects dissolve with time? In 1995, we reported long-term follow-up results of a school-based program designed to prevent depressive symptoms (Gillham et al., 1995). In this study, 69 fifth and sixth graders who participated in the prevention group were compared with a control group of 49 children. The children completed an assessment battery that included the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1985) and the Children’s Attributional Style Questionnaire (CASQ; Kaslow, Tannenbaum, & Seligman, 1978) before the program, following the program, and every 6 months thereafter for 2 years. The prevention group reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms throughout the 2-year follow-up period. Children in the prevention group were also less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms. Explanatory-style scores became more optimistic in the prevention group, and there was evidence that improvements in explanatory style, in part, mediated the program’s effect on depressive symptoms.

In addition, actor attributions were more external and unstable than observer attributions. The motivational-bias position on success–failure asymmetries received no support, as observers showed a more ""defensive"" pattern of attributions than did actors.

The present investigation responds to some psychometric and conceptual difficulties with the original version of the TCP scales by revising the measurement instrument. This paper proposes items for the measurement of six TCP subscales: direct personalization, persecution feelings, stress reaction, positive relational effects, negative relational effects, and like/dislike valence.

"Gender, experience, and self-efficacy in introductory physics",2016,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevphyseducres.12.020105,150,"[This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Gender in Physics.] There is growing evidence of persistent gender achievement gaps in university physics instruction, not only for learning physics content, but also for developing productive attitudes and beliefs about learning physics. These gaps occur in both traditional and interactive-engagement (IE) styles of physics instruction. We investigated one gender gap in the area of attitudes and beliefs. This was men’s and women’s physics self-efficacy, which comprises students’ thoughts and feelings about their capabilities to succeed as learners in physics. According to extant research using pre- and post-course surveys, the self-efficacy of both men and women tends to be reduced after taking traditional and IE physics courses. Moreover, self-efficacy is reduced further for women than for men. However, it remains unclear from these studies whether this gender difference is caused by physics instruction. It may be, for instance, that the greater reduction of women’s self-efficacy in physics merely reflects a broader trend in university education that has little to do with physics per se. We investigated this and other alternative causes, using an in-the-moment measurement technique called the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). We used ESM to collect multiple samples of university students’ feelings of self-efficacy during four types of activity for two one-week periods: (i) an introductory IE physics course, (ii) students’ other introductory STEM courses, (iii) their non-STEM courses, and (iv) their activities outside of school. We found that women experienced the IE physics course with lower self-efficacy than men, but for the other three activity types, women’s self-efficacy was not reliably different from men’s. We therefore concluded that the experience of physics instruction in the IE physics course depressed women’s self-efficacy.

The burden of Alzheimer's disease,2000,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1461145700001905,92,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) imposes a severe burden upon patients and their carers. In particular, family carers of AD patients face extreme hardship and distress that represents a major but often hidden burden on healthcare systems. Carers often experience clinically significant alterations in physical and mental health, particularly depression. A number of individual features of the dementia syndrome that are known to be particularly burdensome to carers include the degree of cognitive impairment, amount of help required with activities of daily living, personality changes and the presence of psychiatric symptoms and behavioural disturbances. The neuropsychiatric features of AD patients can adversely impact the relationship between the patient and caregiver generating feelings of strain, burden and social isolation. Individual characteristics of the caregiver including personality, gender, degree of formal and informal support and physical and mental health, as well as attributional style ('coping style') and expressed emotion (critical or hostile attitudes), also dictate carer burden. As informal caregivers play such a crucial role in the care of AD patients, appropriate management strategies that incorporate interventions which address the specific burdens of the individual caregiver are essential. Reducing the burden of care can be achieved by the combination of a number of individual and general measures, including education, respite and emotion-focused interventions. These measures, accompanied by non-pharmacological strategies, are extremely important in the total care of the AD patient, with the emphasis on maintaining people in the community as long as possible.","['Caregiver burden', 'Respite care', 'Dementia', 'Psychological intervention', 'Feeling', 'Distress', 'Psychology', 'Disease', 'Coping (psychology)', 'Mental health', 'Personality changes', 'Psychiatry', 'Personality', 'Activities of daily living', 'Caregiver stress', 'Medicine', 'Clinical psychology', 'Nursing', 'Pathology', 'Social psychology']",['Alistair Burns'],27,False,The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,[]
Uncertainties and ambiguities: measuring how medical students cope,1994,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.1994.tb02719.x,88,"To develop psychometric measures specific to the ambiguities encountered in medicine and determine their value in predicting medical students' attitudes towards patients and their choice of residency, we administered to senior and first-year medical students a 25-item Likert-type questionnaire to assess their intolerance of ambiguity (ITA). Factor analysis yielded two dimensions that were converted to scales: 'Aversion to uncertainties in clinical medicine' (ITA1) and 'Preference for highly structured training environs' (ITA2). First-year students scored higher on ITA1 and lower on ITA2 than seniors. An excessive reliance on high-technology medicine, a negative orientation toward psychological problems, and Machiavellianism predicted ITA1. ITA1 was the best predictor of senior medical students' negative attributional style toward hypochondriac, geriatric and chronic pain patients. The following rank order of seniors' career choice was predicted by ITA1 scores: internal medicine, psychiatry and family medicine (lowest); radiology, surgery and anaesthesiology (highest). And by ITA2 scores: surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, and surgical subspecialties (lowest); radiology, psychiatry and anaesthesiology (highest).

Observable Social Cognition – A Rating Scale: an interview-based assessment for schizophrenia,2015,https://doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2014.999915,53,"Introduction. Individuals with schizophrenia consistently show impairments in social cognition (SC). SC has become a potential treatment target due to its association with functional outcomes. An alternative method of assessment is to administer an observer-based scale incorporating an informant's ""first hand"" impressions in ratings.Methods. The present study used the Observable Social Cognition: A Rating Scale (OSCARS) in 62 outpatients and 50 non-psychiatric controls (NPCs) to assess performance in domains of SC (e.g. emotion perception, theory of mind).Results. The OSCARS demonstrated sufficient internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Construct validity was assessed through an exploratory factor analysis. Patient OSCARS indices were not significantly correlated with measures of SC with the exception of aggressive attributional style. Individuals with less impairment in SC reacted more aggressively to ambiguous situations. NPC OSCARS were significantly correlated with measures of theory of mind and attributional style. In a combined sample of patients and controls, six of eight items were significantly correlated with the SC task assessing the same domain, providing modest evidence of convergent validity. In patients, the OSCARS was significantly correlated with measures of functional outcome and neurocognition. Last, the OSCARS was found to be significantly associated with functional outcome after the influence of objective measures of SC was statistically removed.Conclusions. The present study provides preliminary evidence that the OSCARS may be useful for clinicians in collecting data about patients' potential real-world SC deficits, in turn increasing the degree to which these impairments may be targeted in treatment.","['Psychology', 'Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming)', 'Cognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Attribution', 'Rating scale', 'Social cognition', 'Perception', 'Clinical psychology', 'Convergent validity', 'Social cognitive theory', 'Psychometrics', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Internal consistency', 'Neuroscience']","['Kristin M.

Data from 330 Japanese and 339 Koreans were analyzed. Multi-group structural equation modeling showed that in both Japan and Korea, punitiveness consisted of three factors (support for harsher punishment, greater criminalization, and use of the death penalty) while the attributional style consisted of two factors (dispositional attribution and situational attribution). In both countries, dispositional attribution was related to punitiveness. Regarding differences, the scores for punitiveness on all three subscale scores and for dispositional attribution were higher in Korea whereas the negative relationship between punitiveness subscale scores and situational attribution was stronger in Japan. This suggests that Japanese are less likely to support punitive measures for criminals and to attribute the causes of crime to the criminals themselves than Koreans. In addition, when deciding on the severity of punishment, Japanese are more likely to take situational causes into consideration.","['Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Attribution']","['Tomoya Mukai', 'Yuma Matsuki', 'Mariko Kimura', 'Fumiya Kondo']",27,True,The Japanese journal of psychology,[]

Recent life events, demographics, family functioning, and mothers' mental health were taken into account when examining outcome. Results. Although the abused children had experienced more negative life events, were from lower socioeconomic groups, had more changes in parent figures, and had mothers who were more psychologically distressed, multiple regression analysis showed that after allowing for these and other demographic factors, there were still significant differences between the groups after the 5 years. The abused children displayed more disturbed behavior, had lower self-esteem, were more depressed or unhappy, and were more anxious than controls. Sexually abused children had significantly higher levels of bingeing, self-injury, and suicide attempts. Conclusions. It is clear that many children who are sexually abused have ongoing problems.

A graph model based author attribution technique for single-class e-mail classification,2015,https://doi.org/10.1109/icis.2015.7166592,15,"Electronic mails have increasingly replaced all written modes of communications for important correspondences including personal and business transactions. An e-mail is given equal significance as a signed document. Hence email impersonation through compromised accounts has become a major threat. In this paper, we have proposed an email style acquisition and classification model for authorship attribution that serves as an effective tool to prevent and detect email impersonation. The proposed model gains knowledge of the author's email style by being trained only with the sample email texts of the author and then identifies if a given email text is a legitimate email of the author or not. Extracting the significant features that represent an author's style from the available concise emails is a big challenge in email authorship attribution. We have proposed to use a graph-based model to precisely extract the unique feature set of the author. We have used one-class SVM classifier to deal with the single-class sample data that consists of only true positive samples. Two classification models have been designed and compared. The first one is a probability model which is based on the probability of occurrence of a feature in the specific email. The second technique is based on inclusive compound probability of a feature to appear in a sentence of an email. Both the models have been evaluated against the public Enron dataset.","['Computer science', 'Electronic mail', 'Classifier (UML)', 'Authorship attribution', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Sentence', 'Class (philosophy)', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Information retrieval', 'Support vector machine', 'Attribution', 'Natural language processing', 'World Wide Web', 'Machine learning', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Linguistics']","['Novino Nirmal.A', 'Kyung-Ah Sohn', 'Tae‐Sun Chung']",12,False,,[]

Study 2 revealed that diffuse-avoiders strategically attempted to circumvent self-diagnostic information by engaging in behaviors beforehand (i.e., listening to noise) that later could be used to obscure the causal bases of their performance on an evaluative task. Study 3 indicated that diffuse-avoiders looked to others for information about how to act and present themselves in social situations and they endorsed Machiavellian tactics such as using flattery and deceit to advance their self-interest.

ATTRIBUTION STYLE AND ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS: A STUDY BASED ON INDIAN CULTURE,2007,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218495807000162,2,"Attribution theory is said to be one of the few psychological theories that can deal with entrepreneurial persistence and setbacks. To explain the question why some entrepreneurs “succeed” in establishing the firm and others do not, recently researchers are emphasizing upon the attribution style of the entrepreneurs. Moreover, US Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) by Gartner and Shaver (2002) is also pointed out that nascent entrepreneurs show self serving bias in their attribution style. To know whether Indian nascent entrepreneurs show the same style of attribution, this study has been conducted. In this study, differentiation has been made upon high and low success group of nascent entrepreneurs in association with attribution style. Results of this study indicate different style of attribution among Indian nascent entrepreneurs.","['Attribution', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Psychology', 'Social psychology', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Dynamics (music)', 'Political science', 'History', 'Law', 'Pedagogy', 'Archaeology']",['Rachana Chattopadhyay'],23,False,Journal of Enterprising Culture,[]
Attenuated intrinsic connectivity within cognitive control network among individuals with remitted depression: Temporal stability and association with negative cognitive styles,2017,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23564,95,"Abstract Many individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience cognitive dysfunction including impaired cognitive control and negative cognitive styles. Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies of individuals with current MDD have documented altered resting‐state connectivity within the default‐mode network and across networks. However, no studies to date have evaluated the extent to which impaired connectivity within the cognitive control network (CCN) may be present in remitted MDD (rMDD), nor have studies examined the temporal stability of such attenuation over time. This represents a major gap in understanding stable, trait‐like depression risk phenotypes. In this study, resting‐state functional connectivity data were collected from 52 unmedicated young adults with rMDD and 47 demographically matched healthy controls, using three bilateral seeds in the CCN (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Mean connectivity within the entire CCN was attenuated among individuals with rMDD, was stable and reliable over time, and was most pronounced with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior parietal lobule, results that were corroborated by supplemental independent component analysis. Attenuated connectivity in rMDD appeared to be specific to the CCN as opposed to representing attenuated within‐network coherence in other networks (e.g., default‐mode, salience). In addition, attenuated connectivity within the CCN mediated relationships between rMDD status and cognitive risk factors for depression, including ruminative brooding, pessimistic attributional style, and negative automatic thoughts. Given that these cognitive markers are known predictors of relapse, these results suggest that attenuated connectivity within the CCN could represent a biomarker for trait phenotypes of depression risk.

Religious attributions pertaining to the causes and cures of mental illness,2004,https://doi.org/10.1080/13674670412331304339,74,"In this Australian study, 126 Protestant Christian participants, 52 females and 74 males, were assessed for their beliefs about the importance of 26 causal variables and 25 treatment variables for two mental disorders: Major Depression and Schizophrenia. Factor analysis revealed four causal factors, common to both conditions, labelled as religious factors, physical factors, coping style and social/environmental stressors. Furthermore, four treatment factors emerged: religious means, professional help, help from others (non-professional) and self-initiated means. Explanatory variables for these beliefs were assessed using: a Religious Beliefs Inventory (RBI) to measure religious beliefs; a Values Survey (VS) including a measure of Christian religious values; and a Religion and Mental Health Inventory (RMHI) to measure cognitive dissonance (cf. Festinger, 1957 Festinger L 1957 A Theory of cognitive dissonance Evanston IL Row & Peterson [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) between religious faith and perceptions of mental-health principles. The results revealed that religious beliefs, religious values and cognitive dissonance function as predictors of the attribution of the causes and treatments, for Major Depression and Schizophrenia, to religious factors.

Computational Methods for Coptic: Developing and Using Part-of-Speech Tagging for Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,2015,https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqv043,10,"This article motivates and details the first implementation of a freely available part of speech tag set and tagger for Coptic. Coptic is the last phase of the Egyptian language family and a descendant of the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Unlike classical Greek and Latin, few resources for digital and computational work have existed for ancient Egyptian language and literature until now. We evaluate our tag set in an inter-annotator agreement experiment and examine some of the difficulties in tagging Coptic data. Using an existing digital lexicon and a small training corpus taken from several genres of literary Sahidic Coptic in the first half of the first millennium, we evaluate the performance of a stochastic tagger applying a fine-grained and coarse-grained set of tags within and outside the domain of literary texts. Our results show that a relatively high accuracy of 94–95% correct automatic tag assignment can be reached for literary texts, with substantially worse performance on documentary papyrus data. We also present some preliminary applications of natural language processing to the study of genre, style, and authorship attribution in Coptic and discuss future directions in applying computational linguistics methods to the analysis of Coptic texts.","['Computer science', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Natural language processing', 'Lexicon', 'Computational linguistics', 'Scholarship', 'Domain (mathematical analysis)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Linguistics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Mathematics', 'Philosophy', 'Programming language', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Political science', 'Law']","['Amir Zeldes', 'Caroline T.

Attribution style of patients with delusion disorder,2006,https://doi.org/10.2298/sarh0602007l,2,"Introduction. Attribution style represents a tendency to explain events by our own actions, or actions of forces and causes, persons or surroundings, which are external. Objective. The objective of our study was the analysis of specific way in which patients with delusion disorders ascribe meanings to events. Method. The test group included 30 patients with delusional disorder, of both sexes, aged between 30 and 53, without serious organic or somatic disorders. In order to determine the specific attribution system, through a wider frame of cognitive style, Rorschach?s cognitive techniques was applied. RESULTS An average value of MMSE score amounted to 28.43 and IQ - to 103.86. The data were evaluated by Comprehensive interpretation system of John Exner, and only those parameters were used that were the most indicative for this analysis. Patients with delusional disorder belonged to ambitent experience type, which pointed to inconsistency because the role of emotions varied during the process of decision making. Processing quality was temporarily significantly reduced to less mature and unsophisticated level, especially in complex situations. Thinking was strongly fixed and inflexible. More than other people, they applied intellectualization in order to annihilate affective experiences, leading thus to delusional thinking disorder in extreme cases. Sometimes, internal conflicts between high self value and awareness that it might not be valid, could lead to delusional expressions, if the environment was especially unsupportive. Conclusion. Attribution style of patients with DD is externalized and implies the ascribing of negative experiences to another person?s action. Marked self-centering and experience of increased personal value dominate over the perception of the environment in these patients, while discrepancy between real self and an ideal is decreased by specific ascribing.","['Medicine', 'Delusion', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Attribution', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Social psychology', 'Literature', 'Psychology', 'Art']","['Ivana Leposavić', 'Ljubica Leposavić']",4,True,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,[]

The learning context in Asian countries is characterised as being highly authoritarian, teaching methods are expository and praise is seldom used. McClelland's achievement motivation approach was found to be ethnocentric, as it ignored situational and contextual factors. Studies are presented that reveal that the meaning of success is different for Asian people and is mediated by affiliative concerns.

Negative Evaluation Bias for Positive Self-Referential Information in Borderline Personality Disorder,2015,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117083,60,"Previous research has suggested that patients meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD) display altered self-related information processing. However, experimental studies on dysfunctional self-referential information processing in BPD are rare. In this study, BPD patients (N = 30) and healthy control participants (N = 30) judged positive, neutral, and negative words in terms of emotional valence. Referential processing was manipulated by a preceding self-referential pronoun, an other-referential pronoun, or no referential context. Subsequently, patients and participants completed a free recall and recognition task. BPD patients judged positive and neutral words as more negative than healthy control participants when the words had self-reference or no reference. In BPD patients, these biases were significantly correlated with self-reported attributional style, particularly for negative events, but unrelated to measures of depressive mood. However, BPD patients did not differ from healthy control participants in a subsequent free recall task and a recognition task. Our findings point to a negative evaluation bias for positive, self-referential information in BPD.

Do (Some) University Endowments Earn Alpha?,2013,https://doi.org/10.2469/faj.v69.n5.4,46,"AbstractThe authors analyzed the returns earned by U.S. educational endowments using style attribution models. For the average endowment, models with only public stock and bond benchmarks explain virtually all the time-series variation in returns, yield no alpha, and generate sensible factor loadings. Elite institutions perform better than public stock and bond benchmarks because of large allocations to alternative investments. The authors found no evidence that manager selection, market timing, and tactical asset allocation generate alpha.Do educational endowments earn superior returns? This question is interesting, given the strong returns earned by some legendary endowments (e.g., Yale University under the management of David Swensen), which have led to the widespread adoption of the so-called endowment model of investing. Using NACUBO/Commonfund data from 1991 to 2011, we analyzed the returns earned by U.S. educational endowments using simple style attribution models.We first documented the returns on the average endowment match the returns of a 60% U.S. stock (S&P 500 Index) and 40% U.S. bond portfolio (Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index). When we restrict the attribution model to public stock (U.S. and international stock) and bond (U.S. bond) benchmarks, the average endowment earns an alpha close to zero, the public stock/bond benchmarks explain 99% of the time-series variation in the return of the average endowment, and the attribution model yields sensible estimates of the typical stock and bond allocations (roughly 60% stock and 40% bonds).We then focused on the returns earned by elite institutions (Ivy League and top-SAT schools) and top-performing endowments (top decile of prior-year performance). These groups earn reliably positive alphas relative to simple public stock/bond benchmarks of 2%–4% per year. However, when we add indices for hedge funds and private equity to our attribution model, the style-adjusted returns for elite institutions and","['Endowment', 'Economics', 'Bond', 'Stock (firearms)', 'Financial economics', 'Yield (engineering)', 'Asset allocation', 'Econometrics', 'Microeconomics', 'Finance', 'Engineering', 'Portfolio', 'Mechanical engineering', 'Philosophy', 'Materials science', 'Epistemology', 'Metallurgy']","['Brad M.

Both categories are rightly speaking processes, and may be repeated several times over within the lifespan of a play. The former is the domain of authors, scribes and printers, the latter the responsibility of actors using their memories to verbally transmit the play in performance. An early modern playtext may thus be (co)written, probably performed and potentially printed, and possibly rewritten, reperformed and reprinted in almost any given combination. It is only to be expected that a number of stylistic ‘complications’ will ensue. The question remains how to determine which stylistic markers characterise which creative domain.

Psychosocial risk factors for chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome following presumed viral illness: a case–control study,1996,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291700035923,52,"This study investigated psychosocial morbidity, coping styles and health locus of control in 64 cases with and without chronic fatigue identified from a cohort of primary care patients recruited 6 months previously with a presumed, clinically diagnosed viral illness. A significant association between chronic fatigue and psychosocial morbidity, somatic symptoms and escape-avoidance coping styles was shown. Chronic fatigue cases were significantly more likely to have a past psychiatric history and a current psychiatric diagnosis based on a standardized clinical interview. Twenty-three of the cases fulfilled criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Such cases were significantly more fatigued than those not fulfilling criteria, but had little excess psychiatric disorder. A principal components analysis provided some evidence for chronic fatigue being separable from general psychosocial morbidity but not from the tendency to have other somatic complaints. Past psychiatric history and psychological distress at the time of the viral illness were risk factors for psychiatric 'caseness' 6 months later, while presence of fatigue, psychologising attributional style and sick certification were significant risk factors for CFS.

We developed and validated a new short questionnaire suitable for the measurement of depressogenic attributions in clinical settings, the Depressive Attributions Questionnaire (DAQ). The 16-item DAQ, and measures of depression and related cognitive concepts were completed by three samples of depressed patients and matched controls, or depressed and non-depressed participants who had been exposed to a recent uncontrollable stressful life event (total N = 375). The DAQ had high (i) internal reliability, (ii) test-retest reliability, (iii) convergent, discriminant and construct validity. It predicted a diagnosis of major depression at 6 months after an uncontrollable stressor, over and above what could be predicted from initial depression severity. Depressed patients rated the scale as acceptable. The DAQ may be a useful short measure of depressogenic attributions, which is easy to administer, and predicts concurrent and future depression. It has possible applications as a screening measure for risk of depression, or as a treatment process measure.","['Psychology', 'Attribution', 'Stressor', 'Depression (economics)', 'Discriminant validity', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognition', 'Developmental psychology', 'Distress', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychiatry', 'Internal consistency', 'Social psychology', 'Economics', 'Macroeconomics']","['Birgit Kleim', 'Désirée Gonzalo', 'Anke Ehlers']",47,True,Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment,[]

"Attributional biases, paranoia, and depression in early psychosis",2013,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12026,31,"Objectives Attributional biases to externalize blame for negative events (externalizing bias) and to target other people for blame (personalizing bias) may constitute a vulnerability to psychosis. However, most research to date has only examined attributional biases in chronic patients. We examined attributional style, paranoia, and depression in early psychosis patients to assess the primacy of attributional biases in psychosis. Design A quasi‐experimental design was adopted to compare the attributional style of patients and controls. Correlates of attributional style were also examined. Methods Early psychosis patients and age‐ and gender‐matched healthy controls completed the ‘Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire’. Paranoid tendencies, suspiciousness, and depression were also assessed in both groups, while severity of current symptoms was assessed in patients. Results A high proportion of patients had persecutory delusions. These patients, however, did not differ from controls in externalizing or personalizing bias. Whereas suspiciousness and persecutory delusions in patients associated with externalizing bias, no bias measures associated with paranoid tendencies in either patients or controls. Counter to the pattern seen for endogenous depression, depression in patients was associated with an increased tendency to attribute events to self and a decreased tendency to attribute events to circumstances. Conclusions These preliminary findings raise doubts about the primacy of attributional biases in psychosis. The novel findings with regard to depression warrant further investigation and suggest that young people, who develop depression after the onset of psychosis, may experience a need to re‐establish a sense of personal control over life events that appear unpredictable.

P. Gr. Vindob. 29788C: hexameter encomium on an un-named emperor,1978,https://doi.org/10.2307/630192,61,"It is now fifty years since Hans Gerstinger published the editio princeps of a Vienna papyrus containing hexameter poems by, as he believed, Pamprepius of Panopolis. Out of seven fragments Gerstinger, working with H. Ibscher, was able to restore one binion of a codex (P. Gr. 29788A-B). A separate leaf (P. Gr. 29788C) was presumed by the restorers to come from the same codex as the binion. The binion contains (1) a hexameter idyll evoking the successive moods of Nature on a day in spring or autumn, (2) a hexameter encomium on the patrician Theagenes of Athens, (3) letters nos. 80 and 90 by St. Gregory Nazianzen. Lines from another hexameter poem are partly legible on two fragments which together constitute the top of the first page of the binion. The only trace of an author's name in the binion is the genitive-ending ο]ụ in the title of the encomium on Theagenes. The separate leaf (P. Gr. 29788C) preserves some fifty lines from a second hexameter encomium, but has been torn in such a way that the line-beginnings are missing from the Verso and the line-endings from the Recto; the names of the author and the addressee have not survived. Gerstinger's opinion that the hand is the same throughout and the writing of a style current in the fifth and sixth centuries has not been challenged. It has seemed to me unnecessary to reproduce in fuller detail the description of the papyrus given in the editio princeps . Should this not be available to the reader, ample information may be found in the reviews by Maas, Körte and Keydell. Gerstinger's attribution of the poems to Pamprepius was greeted by these and other critics with reactions varying from reserve to trenchant scepticism. There is reason to connect the encomium on Theagenes with Pamprepius, since the two were in Athens at the same time, Theagenes as archon, Pamprepius as a grammaticus. But even if we accept that Pamprepius wrote the encomium, the idyll is of higher quality, as Keydell and Maas noted, and might well be t","['Papyrus', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Emperor', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'History', 'Ancient history']",['Ronald C.

"Aggression, attributional style, and locus of control among imprisoned migrants from the former Soviet Union",2018,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbm.2087,3,"Abstract Background In the 1990s, over two million migrants from the former Soviet Union with German ancestry came to Germany, a small number of whom committed offences. Aim The aim of this study is to investigate aggression, locus of control, and attributional style in these (male) migrants imprisoned in Germany. Methods Three groups of men with German ancestry were compared: 1.36 prisoners migrating into Germany from the former Soviet Union (migrant‐P), 2.31 migrating into Germany from the former Soviet Union without a history of offending (community sample; C), and 3.40 German prisoners with no migration experience (native‐P). Results Aggression was high among all prisoners relative to nonoffending migrants. Prisoners tended to be under‐achievers educationally compared with community living migrants. Imprisoned migrants had scores on locus of control and on attribution scales of feeling more influenced by fate and other external factors than had the community migrants, but in a regression model with aggression as the dependent variable and locus of control and attributional style measures as the independent variables, only external attributional style with respect to failure was significantly related to aggression. Implications External attributional style appears to be linked to the probability of aggressive behaviours, leading to unlawful acts and imprisonment. Regardless of whether a person has a migration history or not, as attribution of failure among these relatively low‐achieving prisoners was associated with aggression, loosening these attributional tendencies in therapy might help to reduce aggression. Migration per se was not problematic in these respects in this sample.","['Aggression', 'Locus of control', 'Attribution', 'Psychology', 'German', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Feeling', 'Social psychology', 'Demography', 'Developmental psychology', 'Sociology', 'Geography', 'Archaeology']","['María Isabel Fontao', 'Thomas Roß']",23,False,Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health,[]

The results showed that individuals with the OXTR rs2254298 AA genotype and rs53576 AA/GA genotype reported higher scores on SWB, which suggested that individuals with this genotype experienced more happiness.

The subject of this self-conscious satire, then, is the translation of the Socratic Know yourself into a different genre. With what voice are you to know yourself in satire? Persius' literary landscape is dominated by Roman Callimacheanism, his primary target, and by Horace. In the violence of his attacks on the effeminate followers of Callimachus and in his ugly distortion of the Horatian aesthetic Persius diverges from his predecessor and rejects the balance Horace had struck between refinement and emasculation in his satires. Persius and Horace have characteristic styles and concerns and one may generalize about the differences between them. In addition each of Persius' satires has a more specific relationship, pointed by verbal reminiscence, with one or more poems of Horace. For Satires 4 the Horatian models are Satires 2.1 and Epistles 1.16 and 2.2. After some introductory remarks on the attribution of lines to speakers in Persius Satires 4, I turn in the second part of the article to Horace Satires 2.1 and the critical language with which Horace constructs his aesthetic. As in other programmatic satires, his representation of Lucilius, whatever its relevance for reading Lucilius' poetry and its reception,3 is a vehicle of Horace's self-representation.

Authorship attribution for textual data on online social networks,2017,https://doi.org/10.1109/ic3.2017.8284311,8,"Authorship Attribution, (AA) is a process of determining a particular document is written by which author among a list of suspected authors. Authorship attribution has been the problem from last six decades; when there were handwritten documents needed to be identified for the genuine author. Due to the technology advancement and increase in cybercrime and unlawful activities, this problem of AA becomes forth most important to trace out the author behind online messages. Over the past, many years research has been conducted to attribute the authorship of an author on the basis of their writing style as all authors possess different distinctiveness while writing a piece of document. This paper presents a comparative study of various machine learning approaches on different feature sets for authorship attribution on short text. The Twitter dataset has been used for comparison with varying sample size of a dataset of 10 prolific authors with various combinations of feature sets. The significance and impact of combinations of features while inferring different stylometric features has been reflected. The results of different approaches are compared based on their accuracy and precision values.","['Authorship attribution', 'Optimal distinctiveness theory', 'Computer science', 'TRACE (psycholinguistics)', 'Attribution', 'Stylometry', 'Information retrieval', 'Feature (linguistics)', 'Writing style', 'Process (computing)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Sample (material)', 'Natural language processing', 'Data science', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Social psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Chemistry', 'Archaeology', 'Chromatography', 'Psychotherapist', 'History', 'Operating system']","['Ritu Banga', 'Pulkit Mehndiratta']",23,False,,[]

Perceptions of hostility by persons with and without persecutory delusions,2009,https://doi.org/10.1080/13546800902732970,93,"Current models of paranoia propose that ambiguous situations, in which cues regarding the intentions of others are lacking, may be perceived as hostile by persons with persecutory delusions (PD). Thus, a social-cognitive bias for the perception of hostility may be present. In this study, the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) was used to present situations that are ambiguous regarding the intentions of others. It was predicted that on the AIHQ, persons with PD would show greater levels of perceived hostility, blame, and aggression than both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric controls.The sample comprised 32 persons with PD, 28 persons without PD (psychiatric controls), and 50 healthy participants (nonpsychiatric controls). Participants completed the AIHQ along with measures of paranoia, attributional style, depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and public self-consciousness.As predicted, the group with PD showed greater perceptions of hostility, blame, and aggression scores for ambiguous situations on the AIHQ. Also, the AIHQ Hostility bias score was predictive of paranoid ideation.Persons with PD showed a social-cognitive bias for perceiving hostility in ambiguous situations. The bias appears to be specific as it was not found in the psychiatric or nonpsychiatric control groups. Suggestions for future research are discussed.","['Hostility', 'Paranoia', 'Psychology', 'Attribution bias', 'Aggression', 'Social perception', 'Clinical psychology', 'Anxiety', 'Perception', 'Cognition', 'Attribution', 'Cognitive bias', 'Developmental psychology', 'Psychiatry', 'Social psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Dennis R.

Genetic characterization of Sardinia grapevine cultivars by SSR markers analysis,2007,https://doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2007.41.4.837,33,"&lt;p style=""text-align: justify;""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim&lt;/strong&gt;: The objective of the present study is to investigate the molecular characteristics of Sardinian grapevine cultivars to evaluate cases of synonyms and false attributions to protect local agro-biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=""text-align: justify;""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and results&lt;/strong&gt;: The SSR analysis (13 loci) has been used to define the DNA fingerprint and the relationships with Sardinian grapevine cultivars.

A longitudinal twin and sibling study of the hopelessness theory of depression in adolescence and young adulthood,2016,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291716000489,25,"Maladaptive cognitive biases such as negative attributional style and hopelessness have been implicated in the development and maintenance of depression. According to the hopelessness theory of depression, hopelessness mediates the association between attributional style and depression. The aetiological processes underpinning this influential theory remain unknown. The current study investigated genetic and environmental influences on hopelessness and its concurrent and longitudinal associations with attributional style and depression across adolescence and emerging adulthood. Furthermore, given high co-morbidity between depression and anxiety, the study investigated whether these maladaptive cognitions constitute transdiagnostic cognitive content common to both internalizing symptoms.A total of 2619 twins/siblings reported attributional style (mean age 15 and 17 years), hopelessness (mean age 17 years), and depression and anxiety symptoms (mean age 17 and 20 years).Partial correlations revealed that attributional style and hopelessness were uniquely associated with depression but not anxiety symptoms. Hopelessness partially mediated the relationship between attributional style and depression. Hopelessness was moderately heritable (A = 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.28-0.47), with remaining variance accounted for by non-shared environmental influences. Independent pathway models indicated that a set of common genetic influences largely accounted for the association between attributional style, hopelessness and depression symptoms, both concurrently and across development.The results provide novel evidence that associations between attributional style, hopelessness and depression symptoms are largely due to shared genetic liability, suggesting developmentally stable biological pathways underpinning the hopelessness theory of depression. Both attributional style and hopelessness constituted unique cognitive content in depression.
